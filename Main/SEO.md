**SEO** is the act of optimizing content for *search engines*, most commonly for google.
- Traffic from SEO is **Free**
- Traffic from SEO is **Consistent** (Once your ranking is high)

### How does Google search engine work?
- It uses **crawlers** (spiders), which gather publicly available information from the web.
	- They start with a list of URLs to crawl, called **seeds**. 
	- They then following the **hyperlinks** (anchor tags) on the page to other websites.
	- They then crawl the newly discovered pages, this continues on and on, allowing them to build a massive content.
	- They then add it to Googles **Search Index**.
- Now when a user searches, google takes keywords from the prompt, to categorize them, to find the **most relevant answer**.
- **The knowledge graph**: *"Goes beyond keyword matching to better understand the people, places and things you care about."* - Google
- **How the search algorithm works**:
	- Googles goal is to search all websites within they're search index.
	- The algorithm looks at many factors, including the **words** of your query, **relevance** and **usability** of pages, **expertise** of sources, and your **location** and **settings**.
	- The **weight** applied to each factor varies depending on the nature of your query:
		- If you were to search about an event that happened fairly recently (a couple months), google would come up with the latest news on it, not from the same day **Unless it is extremely informative.**
	- **Search intent**: What the user wants to see when searching something.
		- You need to understand that google does **accurately** get the search intent correct.
		- You need to think of various prompts that users would search, and find your page, and mold your content around that. For example:
			- A portfolio website.
			- **Target Audience:** Small businesses, looking for a website to be made.
			- **Sample prompts** - things they would search up.
