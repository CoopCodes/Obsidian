```python
import os

print(os.getcwd()) # This prints where the .py file is
os.chdir('Users/patrick/Desktop/video-files') # Changes where the directory is 
print(os.getcwd()) # Now this will print 'Users/patrick/Desktop/video-files'

print(os.listdir()) # This prints all files and folders in directory
```

#### Copying files
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

os.chdir('Users/patrick/Desktop/video-files')
Path("Data").mkdir(exist_ok=true) # Creates directory, doesn't if already exists

for file in os.listdir():
	shutil.copy(file, "data") # File to move, and directoryFile to move, and directory)
```

# The program
The program should copy all files specified in `files`, it should also store in a file, what the directory looked like before, and if any new files were made.

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

remote_dir = "C:/Users/.../Thumsters_Remote/"
local_dir = "C:/Users/.../Thumsters_Local/"
paths = ['App.tsx', 'Components/']

os.chdir(remote_dir)
for file in os.listdir():
	if (file === )
```

How to check if an item in in an array python

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

To check if an item is in an array in Python, you can use the `in` operator. Here's an example:

```python
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if 3 in array:
    print("3 is in the array")
else:
    print("3 is not in the array")
```

Output:
```
3 is in the array
```

In your specific case, you can modify the code like this:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

remote_dir = "C:/Users/.../Thumsters_Remote/"
local_dir = "C:/Users/.../Thumsters_Local/"
files = ['App.tsx', 'Components/']

os.chdir(remote_dir)
for file in os.listdir():
    if any(file.startswith(f) for f in files):
        # File is in the list of files to copy
        shutil.copy(file, local_dir)
```

This code will copy the files specified in the `files` list from the `remote_dir` to the `local_dir`.

raw string in python

how to do just a single backslash in string in python

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

In Python, you can use a raw string by prefixing the string literal with the letter `r`. A raw string treats backslashes as literal characters and does not interpret them as escape characters. Here's an example:

```python
raw_string = r"This is a raw string with a single backslash: \\"
print(raw_string)
```

Output:
```
This is a raw string with a single backslash: \\
```

As you can see, the double backslash `\\` is treated as a single backslash in the raw string.

If you don't want to use a raw string and want to include just a single backslash in a regular string, you can escape it by using a double backslash `\\`. Here's an example:

```python
regular_string = "This is a regular string with a single backslash: \\"
print(regular_string)
```

Output:
```
This is a regular string with a single backslash: \
```

In this case, the double backslash `\\` is interpreted as a single backslash in the regular string.

Why is the following python not working?:
```python
folders = list(filter(lambda x: not('.' in x) or not(x == ''), local_path.split('\\\\')))
```



<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

The issue with the provided Python code is related to the logical operator used in the lambda function. 

The expression `not('.' in x) or not(x == '')` in the lambda function is incorrect because it will always evaluate to `True` for any value of `x`. This is because the `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the conditions is `True`. 

To fix the code, you can use the logical operator `and` instead of `or`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
folders = list(filter(lambda x: not ('.' in x) and not (x == ''), local_path.split('\\\\')))
```

By using the `and` operator, both conditions need to be `True` for the lambda function to return `True`. This ensures that the lambda function filters out elements that contain a dot (`.`) or are empty strings.
