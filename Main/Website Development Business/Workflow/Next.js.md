# What is next.js? Is it a CMS? 

Next.js is not a CMS (Content Management System) but rather a framework for building server-rendered React applications. It is an open-source JavaScript framework created by Vercel (formerly Zeit) that allows developers to build modern web applications with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and automatic code splitting. Next.js provides a streamlined development experience and helps optimize performance by pre-rendering pages and serving them as static HTML files. It also offers features like client-side routing, API routes, and built-in CSS support. While Next.js can be used with various CMS platforms, it is not a CMS itself.



# Give an example of a website using Next.js and the tech stack it could use, how each item in the tech stack interacts with each other

Sure! Let's consider an example of a blog website built using Next.js. Here's a possible tech stack and how each component interacts with each other:

1. Next.js: Next.js acts as the main framework for building the website. It handles server-side rendering, routing, and other features.

2. React: Next.js is built on top of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React components are used to create the website's UI and handle interactivity.

3. Node.js: Next.js runs on top of Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js allows server-side rendering and provides a backend environment for handling requests and serving data.

4. Express.js: Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It can be used with Next.js to handle server-side routing and API endpoints.

5. MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that can be used to store blog posts, user data, and other content. It interacts with the backend (Node.js/Express.js) to handle data storage and retrieval.

6. CSS-in-JS: Next.js supports various CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or emotion. These libraries allow developers to write CSS styles directly in their React components, making it easier to manage styles and apply them dynamically.

7. Markdown: Next.js can use markdown files to store blog post content. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows easy formatting of text. Next.js can parse markdown files and render them as HTML for the blog posts.

8. API Routes: Next.js provides built-in API routes that allow you to create serverless functions to handle API requests. These routes can interact with the backend, database, or external APIs to fetch data or perform operations.

In this tech stack, Next.js handles the frontend rendering and routing, while Node.js and Express.js handle the backend logic and API endpoints. MongoDB stores the data, and CSS-in-JS libraries handle the styling. Markdown files are used to store blog post content, and API routes provide a way to interact with the backend.

# Would next.js be considered apart of the front end or back end?

Next.js is primarily considered a front-end framework. It is built on top of React, a front-end JavaScript library, and is used for rendering the user interface and handling client-side routing. Next.js enables server-side rendering and static site generation, which are front-end techniques for improving performance and SEO.

However, Next.js also has some back-end capabilities. It can handle server-side rendering, API routes, and serverless functions, which involve server-side logic. Next.js runs on top of Node.js, a back-end JavaScript runtime environment. It can interact with databases and handle server-side operations.

So, while Next.js is primarily focused on the front-end, it blurs the line between front-end and back-end by providing features that involve both aspects.
