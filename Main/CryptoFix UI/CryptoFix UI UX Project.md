*This document is going to document how the teacher thinks when designing the **CryptoFix Website***
# Client Brief Overview
## Business Information
- **Business information:**
	- **Extract**: *We’re an ad agency in the cryptocurrency industry. Advertisers can join CryptoFix and create ad campaigns that will be placed on a variety of cryptocurrency websites & apps (**A publisher**). These properties include cryptocurrency exchanges, blogs, and influencers. We allow exchanges, blog owners and influencers in the crypto space to join as publishers and list their ratings and ad types.*
	- Think Cryptocurrency
	- Blockchain
	- **Advertising**
	- They're basically a middleman company, and they bring publishers and advertisers together.
		- A publisher is a something that has a blog, our could be an influencer. These people are how advertisers can further advertise.
		- And the advertisers want to make advertisements to sell.
	- They are wanting to connect the publishers and advertisers, and the platform is for publishers to make themselves known to advertisers. Just like a service such as fiver.
	- **Thought process**: He read the information, and immediately unpacked what the company was, and tried to **understand it for himself.**

- **USP**:
	- **Extract**: *We have facilitated a relationship with the top 5 cryptocurrency exchanges. We offer our advertisers the most visibility in this space, as compared to our competitors.*
	- If a client responds with their USP, whatever they say first is the most important selling point. **Factor that into your design**.
	- What is the USP About this business? They have relationships with top crypto exchanges. 
		- This means that advertisers can trust that there will be good publishers on the platform.
		- IF you go with company for advertisements, you will get the most views. 
	- **Thought process:** Thought of the importance of this information, realized this needs to be factored into the design.

- **Target Audience**:
	- **Extract**: *25 to 34 year old. Males (90%). Global market.*
	- Some businesses won't know what your talking about, you have to education them.
	- Its **Global**, not local like a local cementing company, not physical.
	- **Thought process**: Thought of the importance, and how it could be factored into the design.
- **Is this a website redesign?**:
	- **Extract**: *Yes, but we want a complete redesign. We don’t want you to take any inspiration from it.*
	- Sometimes, we need to follow branding guidelines.
	- **Thought process**:
- **Competitor URL's**:
	- The owners may send competitors websites, but they may not be **direct** competitors.
	- Don't use design trends that you see everywhere on competitors websites.
		- **Don't copy off of competitors.**
	- **Cointraffic**![[Pasted image 20231219225050.png]]
		- Keep Navbars to a max of **7**, he would have taken the left 6 the links, centered them, so they are differentiated from the **log in & sign up** links.
		- It's important to show a **trusted by** section.
	- **Thought process**: Thought of the importance of the information. The information is valuable because it is an actual website. Its good to know what your going up against, and he *picked on things that they are doing wrong.*

## Client Preferences
*If a client has a preference that does not make sense, and will work against them, its up to you to **educate them.***
- **Company image**:
	- **Extract**: *We want a more serious and professional tone.*
	- This is all about helping your design, it makes **All of your design choices.** To MAKE sure that the design is correctly portraying the company image.
	- If the brand wants to betrayed as fun and energetic, then you wouldn't design with black and white, or desaturated colors.
	- Sometimes clients just leave it up to the freelancer, based on the business. 
	- **Thought process**: thought of the importance of this information. Realized it can be **heavily** incorporated into the design, and will make all the design choices.
- **Color theme preferences**:
	- **Extract**: *We don’t have any particular color schemes in mind. We want to avoid light pinks and browns.*
- **Typography / Font preferences**:
	- No comic sans or serif fonts.
	- Obviously.

## Features and Content
- **Core features of service**:
	- **Extract**: 
		- We’re partnered with the 5 largest exchanges  
		- Advertisers can mint their ad campaign with NFT Ads  
		- Advertisers can pay in crypto & USD.
	- **These 3 core features should be featured prominently on the landing page**
- **Pages**:
	- 5 Different pages:
		- Home Page
		- Ad Types page
		- Starting a campaign
		- Login Form
		- Contact & Info
	- Depending on the client, they may not be able to provide all the pages they need. **So its up to you too structure that content before receiving it.**
	- Its important to ask what pages.

## Learning Outcome:
His thinking process when uncovering information is:
1. **What is the importance of the information?** - Is the information going to determine a lot of the design? Or not?
2. **Unpack the information** - Understand what the information means, for example if it is the business overview, understand what the business is about, and how they work. And what they're clients want.
3. **In what ways can this information be reflected in design** - will it effect the color scheme? Give examples, (*e.g. this information means that the color scheme will be saturated, to reflect a happy brand.*).

# Wireframing
- What is a wireframe?
	- A quick way to create the physical structure of the layout, based on the client brief, and the necessities of the project.
- Think about what means of creating it you want? Pen and paper, Figma, etc. 
	- Should be based on the requirements, and your skill.
- Do you need a wireframe?
	- Not always, Maybe it's a project for yourself, and you just want to start it right away.
	- If you have a client, or a boss, or different stakeholders. You should use it, because it can help you save time, here is a situation:
		- You're working with a front-end developer working with html and CSS, but is not a designer. They design with code, not in Figma. But when design decisions need to be made, it is harder to make changes. 
		- When your dealing with a client, and the client wants to make changes, its harder to do that with a higher fidelity mockup, than with a wireframe.
	- You need to convey to your stakeholders that it **isn't** the end result.
## Landing page wireframe
- **Making the wireframe**:
	- Talking through what needs to go first.
	- **Stick to conventions, this isn't some Artsy project, it is for a client.**
	- Create a grid, but just have 1 column, to show the margins.
	- For the navbar you don't need to include the links, this mockup should be very quick.
	- Headline section:
		- The client may not have ad copy for the heading, so you can use lorem ipsum, or make it up yourself for placeholder.
		- He goes into the client brief, and tries to find a good headline.
		- Or you could do '*Primary headline for the landing page*'.
		- Referred back to the client brief, to find the next section. He will try to show some of the core features of the business at the top of the page.
			- We can feature the elements in the hero section. In 3 different columns, under the headline.
		- A call to action.
	- ***Spend a lot of time in the client brief to know what it is you want to put down.***
	- Analytics system will be the next section.
		- A 2 column section, assuming they will provide us with a chart showing what the system looks like.
		- Took like 20 second to make it, just making sure he includes the relevant content.
		- **The wireframe isn't so much the small details in design, this is just a simple mockup.**
	- Testimonial.
		- Put a lot of whitespace around to emphasis the importance of the section.
		- Doesn't even put the testimonial in or the card or anything.
	- Exchanges we offer:
		- **Extract**: * Each exchange has the ability to offer 4 types of ads: Interstitial, retargetting, email and shoutout. Not all exchanges offer the same thing. *
			- CryptoSpace (Offers all 4)  
			- AdBlocks (All but retargetting)  
			- Mooners (Interstitial and retargetting)  
			- ForexCrypt (All but shoutout)  
			- JunctionSpace (Only Interstitial)*
		- We have to figure out a way to show this information in a visual way, but also communicate what the exchange offers.
		- A table, rows of the exchanges, and tick boxes if indicated what types they offer. ![[Pasted image 20231220104126.png]]
	- Companies that have used them.
	- Another call to action.
	- Footer
	- Do we want to make wireframes for other pages?
		- Sometimes you may have an employer or client, where they want every page to have a wireframe.
		- If not you can just do non-standard pages, standard pages are like login forms, contact forms.
			- For each page, think if there are some graphics on the page that would need explanation to the client.

## Ad Types and Campaign Wireframes.
- You could create components on the wireframes, but its pointless.
- How to create a layout that conveys the different ad types
- Looking through the information, and formulating what content needs to be there.
- Wireframes 

## Learning outcome
*The purpose of a wireframe is to show the client what information will be displayed, and how it will. How you will use structural design techniques to put emphasis on specific information.*
He followed the following steps:
1. Think about what pages you need, if it is a standard page
2. Start the first page:
	1. Think of the required section.
	2. What information does the section need?
		- Is the information important, and should be something other than plain text?
	3. Create a basic wireframe of the design, communicating the information not only through text, but through design.
3. Repeat step 2.

# High-fidelity Mockup/Design
*Using the structure determined in the mockup, to create a design.*
## Navigation Design
- The first consideration when designing from a wireframe, is going to be the <span style="color: #8200E9">Primary color</span>
- Create a variable for the color.
- The primary color can be used to create all the other colors.
- Make the background color, and add it to the styles.
- Add all the colors to the newly created design system.
- Make sure the client always includes the logo.

- Create a desktop grid.
- Look back to the CB (Client Brief), and find the pages needed
- You can ask the client, what font they're logo is.
- Create components for the links, place them in the assets, and create hover & press effects.
- Style the design system.
- Think of all the situations when prototyping.
- Think if pages are similar, and group them visually accordingly. This could be through:
	- Physically grouping
	- Changing color
	- Making it a button.
- Take the navbar and make it a component.

## Background Design
- Based on the business be crypto, choose an image from an unsplash that has to do with polygons and block with
- Think of ways to create good contrast, and same colors, to make it fit in.

## Hero Section Design
- Add typography section to display text types.
- Add content for the section, and change things till its good.
- If text isn't going to be reused, you don't necessarily need to create a style for it.
- Find the next information that needs to be displayed.
- You CAN offset things off of the grid, to make things more visual.
- Use icons to reinforce information if need.
- Don't overuse the primary color, only do it form important things.
