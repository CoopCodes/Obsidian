*This document is going to document how the teacher thinks when designing the **CryptoFix Website***
# Client Brief Overview
## Business Information
- **Business information:**
	- **Extract**: *We’re an ad agency in the cryptocurrency industry. Advertisers can join CryptoFix and create ad campaigns that will be placed on a variety of cryptocurrency websites & apps (**A publisher**). These properties include cryptocurrency exchanges, blogs, and influencers. We allow exchanges, blog owners and influencers in the crypto space to join as publishers and list their ratings and ad types.*
	- Think Cryptocurrency
	- Blockchain
	- **Advertising**
	- They're basically a middleman company, and they bring publishers and advertisers together.
		- A publisher is a something that has a blog, our could be an influencer. These people are how advertisers can further advertise.
			- And the advertisers want to make advertisements to sell.
	- They are wanting to connect the publishers and advertisers, and the platform is for publishers to make themselves known to advertisers. Just like a service such as fiver.
	- **Thought process**: He read the information, and immediately unpacked what the company was, and tried to **understand it for himself.**

- **USP**:
	- **Extract**: *We have facilitated a relationship with the top 5 cryptocurrency exchanges. We offer our advertisers the most visibility in this space, as compared to our competitors.*
	- If a client responds with their USP, whatever they say first is the most important selling point. **Factor that into your design**.
	- What is the USP About this business? They have relationships with top crypto exchanges. 
		- This means that advertisers can trust that there will be good publishers on the platform.
		- IF you go with company for advertisements, you will get the most views. 
	- **Thought process:** Thought of the importance of this information, realized this needs to be factored into the design.

- **Target Audience**:
	- **Extract**: *25 to 34 year old. Males (90%). Global market.*
	- Some businesses won't know what your talking about, you have to education them.
	- Its **Global**, not local like a local cementing company, not physical.
	- **Thought process**: Thought of the importance, and how it could be factored into the design.
- **Is this a website redesign?**:
	- **Extract**: *Yes, but we want a complete redesign. We don’t want you to take any inspiration from it.*
	- Sometimes, we need to follow branding guidelines.
	- **Thought process**:
- **Competitor URL's**:
	- The owners may send competitors websites, but they may not be **direct** competitors.
	- Don't use design trends that you see everywhere on competitors websites.
		- **Don't copy off of competitors.**
	- **Cointraffic**![[Pasted image 20231219225050.png]]
		- Keep Navbars to a max of **7**, he would have taken the left 6 the links, centered them, so they are differentiated from the **log in & sign up** links.
		- It's important to show a **trusted by** section.
	- **Thought process**: Thought of the importance of the information. The information is valuable because it is an actual website. Its good to know what your going up against, and he *picked on things that they are doing wrong.*

## Client Preferences
*If a client has a preference that does not make sense, and will work against them, its up to you to **educate them.***
- **Company image**:
	- **Extract**: *We want a more serious and professional tone.*
	- This is all about helping your design, it makes **All of your design choices.** To MAKE sure that the design is correctly portraying the company image.
	- If the brand wants to betrayed as fun and energetic, then you wouldn't design with black and white, or desaturated colors.
	- Sometimes clients just leave it up to the freelancer, based on the business. 
	- **Thought process**: thought of the importance of this information. Realized it can be **heavily** incorporated into the design, and will make all the design choices.
- **Color theme preferences**:
	- **Extract**: *We don’t have any particular color schemes in mind. We want to avoid light pinks and browns.*
- **Typography / Font preferences**:
	- No comic sans or serif fonts.
	- Obviously.
- **Additional Comments**:
		- **Extract**: *We need a top notch design that’s responsive and works well on all devices. We’re looking forward to what you produce!*

## Features and Content
- **Core features of service**:
	- **Extract**: 
		- We’re partnered with the 5 largest exchanges  
		- Advertisers can mint their ad campaign with NFT Ads  
		- Advertisers can pay in crypto & USD.
	- **These 3 core features should be featured prominently on the landing page**
- **Pages**:
	- 5 Different pages:
		- Home Page
		- Ad Types page
		- Starting a campaign
		- Login Form
		- Contact & Info
	- Depending on the client, they may not be able to provide all the pages they need. **So its up to you too structure that content before receiving it.**
	- Its important to ask what pages.

## Learning Outcome:
His thinking process when uncovering information is:
1. **What is the importance of the information?** - Is the information going to determine a lot of the design? Or not?
2. **Unpack the information** - Understand what the information means, for example if it is the business overview, understand what the business is about, and how they work. And what they're clients want.
3. **In what ways can this information be reflected in design** - will it effect the color scheme? Give examples, (*e.g. this information means that the color scheme will be saturated, to reflect a happy brand.*).

# Wireframing
- What is a wireframe?
	- A quick way to create the physical structure of the layout, based on the client brief, and the necessities of the project.
- Think about what means of creating it you want? Pen and paper, Figma, etc. 
	- Should be based on the requirements, and your skill.
- Do you need a wireframe?
	- Not always, Maybe it's a project for yourself, and you just want to start it right away.
	- If you have a client, or a boss, or different stakeholders. You should use it, because it can help you save time, here is a situation:
		- You're working with a front-end developer working with html and CSS, but is not a designer. They design with code, not in Figma. But when design decisions need to be made, it is harder to make changes. 
		- When your dealing with a client, and the client wants to make changes, its harder to do that with a higher fidelity mockup, than with a wireframe.
	- You need to convey to your stakeholders that it **isn't** the end result.
## Landing page wireframe
- **Making the wireframe**:
	- Talking through what needs to go first.
	- **Stick to conventions, this isn't some Artsy project, it is for a client.**
	- Create a grid, but just have 1 column, to show the margins.
	- For the navbar you don't need to include the links, this mockup should be very quick.
	- Headline section:
		- The client may not have ad copy for the heading, so you can use lorem ipsum, or make it up yourself for placeholder.
		- He goes into the client brief, and tries to find a good headline.
		- Or you could do '*Primary headline for the landing page*'.
		- Referred back to the client brief, to find the next section. He will try to show some of the core features of the business at the top of the page.
			- We can feature the elements in the hero section. In 3 different columns, under the headline.
		- A call to action.
	- ***Spend a lot of time in the client brief to know what it is you want to put down.***
	- Analytics system will be the next section.
		- A 2 column section, assuming they will provide us with a chart showing what the system looks like.
		- Took like 20 second to make it, just making sure he includes the relevant content.
		- **The wireframe isn't so much the small details in design, this is just a simple mockup.**
	- Testimonial.
		- Put a lot of whitespace around to emphasis the importance of the section.
		- Doesn't even put the testimonial in or the card or anything.
	- Exchanges we offer:
		- **Extract**: * Each exchange has the ability to offer 4 types of ads: Interstitial, retargetting, email and shoutout. Not all exchanges offer the same thing. *
			- CryptoSpace (Offers all 4)  
			- AdBlocks (All but retargetting)  
			- Mooners (Interstitial and retargetting)  
			- ForexCrypt (All but shoutout)  
			- JunctionSpace (Only Interstitial)*
		- We have to figure out a way to show this information in a visual way, but also communicate what the exchange offers.
		- A table, rows of the exchanges, and tick boxes if indicated what types they offer. ![[Pasted image 20231220104126.png]]
	- Companies that have used them.
	- Another call to action.
	- Footer
	- Do we want to make wireframes for other pages?
		- Sometimes you may have an employer or client, where they want every page to have a wireframe.
		- If not you can just do non-standard pages, standard pages are like login forms, contact forms.
			- For each page, think if there are some graphics on the page that would need explanation to the client.

## Ad Types and Campaign Wireframes.
- You could create components on the wireframes, but its pointless.
- How to create a layout that conveys the different ad types
- Looking through the information, and formulating what content needs to be there.
- Wireframes 

## Learning outcome
*The purpose of a wireframe is to show the client what information will be displayed, and how it will. How you will use structural design techniques to put emphasis on specific information.*
He followed the following steps:
1. Think about what pages you need, if it is a standard page
2. Start the first page:
	1. Think of the required section.
	2. What information does the section need?
		- Is the information important, and should be something other than plain text?
	3. Create a basic wireframe of the design, communicating the information not only through text, but through design.
3. Repeat step 2.

# High-fidelity Mockup/Design
*Using the structure determined in the mockup, to create a design.*
## Home Page Design
### Navigation Design
- The first consideration when designing from a wireframe, is going to be the <span style="color: #8200E9">Primary color</span>
- Create a variable for the color.
- The primary color can be used to create all the other colors.
- Make the background color, and add it to the styles.
- Add all the colors to the newly created design system.
- Make sure the client always includes the logo.

- Create a desktop grid.
- Look back to the CB (Client Brief), and find the pages needed
- You can ask the client, what font they're logo is.
- Create components for the links, place them in the assets, and create hover & press effects.
- Style the design system.
- Think of all the situations when prototyping.
- Think if pages are similar, and group them visually accordingly. This could be through:
	- Physically grouping
	- Changing color
	- Making it a button.
- Take the navbar and make it a component.

### Background Design
- Based on the business be crypto, choose an image from an unsplash that has to do with polygons and block with
- Think of ways to create good contrast, and same colors, to make it fit in.

### Hero Section Design
- Add typography section to display text types.
- Add content for the section, and change things till its good.
- If text isn't going to be reused, you don't necessarily need to create a style for it.
- Find the next information that needs to be displayed.
- You CAN offset things off of the grid, to make things more visual.
- Use icons to reinforce information if need.
- Don't overuse the primary color, only do it for important things.

### Analytics Section Design
- Typing the information that is needed to be displayed.
- Heading.
- Adding New type to design system.
- Thinking through the visual hierarchy that is required for the information.
- Brainstorming what element would be good to display data:
	- Chart.


### Testimonial Section Design
- When there is a lot of content, you can't go wrong with centering.
- **How can this information be displayed effectively, in a visual way? And effectively differentiate/highlight important information.**
- Referring back to the client brief when need
- Making sure things are switched up, adding a different background for different sections


### Exchanges Section Design
- Once the first page is finished, the design system is mostly established.
- Think through the colors.
- Just doing what you think is good.


### Logos Section Design
- When you feature logos, make sure they are designed consistently, with the same color.


### Footer Section Design
- you can use links that don't need to be shown in navigation
- Make sure **differentiated content**, is visually different
- Keep icons either **Filled or unfilled**
- Create a component of the footer section


## Ad Types Page Design
- Duplicate the page, and get started on this page.

## Learning Outcome
When starting a **High-fidelity** mockup, do the following:
1. Find a **Primary** color that the whole design will follow, all **secondary** & **other** colors can be a variation of this on the HSL.
2. Create a **Design System**, with the following pages:
	- **Colors** - Contains the all the colors used in the mockup.
	- **Typography** - Contains the fonts used, and the different **text styles** used in the mockup.
		- Dependent on ***Colors***
	- **Components** - Contains all the components used in the mockup, such as buttons and navigations.
		- Should contain frames containing different components, **sorted & named based on how many nested components there are.** E.g. Footer has 1
		- Dependent on ***Typography*** & ***Colors***
	- **Layout Specifications** - Contains layout guidelines, frames showing the sizes of each different device, and it's corresponding grid layout. **This should be populated before start of design.**
- **This design system will be populated throughout the development**
3. For each page following the following steps:
	1.  For each section follow the following steps:
		1. Look at the requirements of the section in the **client brief**.
		2. **Brainstorm** how can this information be displayed **effectively**, in a **visual way**? And effectively **differentiate/highlight** important information. The thought-up design should:
			- Display the information **aesthetically**, sticking to the design system.
			- Any important information should be **differentiated** from the other information.
			- For example: When creating the Nav Bar, you look up all the pages on the website, and include them. And the link to the CTA page is different to the other links, **highlighting** the importance of it. Additionally the *Login & Start Campaign* were grouped together, and right aligned compared to the other links. *(See [[CryptoFix UI UX Project#Navigation Design|Navigation Design]])*
			- Take into account the following notes:
				- **Icons** - Use Icons to reinforce information visually.
				- Don't overuse the **primary color**.
				- **Center** - When there is a lot of content, you can't go wrong with centering.
				- **The grid is not final** - not everything has to be aligned on the grid, if it works, it works. *(see [[CryptoFix UI UX Project#Hero Section Design|Hero Section Design]])*
				- **Switch things up** - Change the background color or image.
				- **DO NOT Overthink** - If it looks good go with it, if your stuck, move onto the next section.
				- **Icon style** - if you are using icons, make sure they are the same color, and same style/fill.
		3. Ensure that when creating new colors or text styles or components, **create** it in the design system. Do this for:
			- New **Colors** - When creating a new color, *most* of the time, the color will be a variation of the **Primary Color**, the naming convention of the color should be the following: `color-primary-{light_value}`. Where `light_value` is the how light it is on the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Light) color system. This color should be created as a *color style*, and displayed in the ***Design System/Colors***.
			- New **Text Styles** - When adding text, the size, weight, color, and possibly font are variable. Each change to this should be created as a *text style*, and displayed in ***Design System/Typography***
			- New **Components** - This is often composed of colors and type. Each component should have a descriptive name, and be created within ***Design System/Components/{nesting_level}***.
				- Additionally, each component should be **prototyped** accordingly, depending on the requirements and the component.
		4. Review the component, and ensure it has good **Visual Hierarchy** & follows the **design system**. 
		5. If the section will be repeated throughout pages (e.g. a Navbar or footer). Create it as a **component**, and display it in ***Design System/Components/{nesting_level}***.
		6. Repeat steps 1-6 for each require section, which were defined in the [[CryptoFix UI UX Project#Wireframing|Wireframe]].
	1. Duplicate the page, and delete most of the content, and repeat.

# Tablet Design
- Create a new page *Tablet Design*. 

## Tablet Homepage Design
- Copy the current desktop homepage, and copy it into the page.
- Create the tablet frame with the correct sizing.

### Navigation Tablet Design
- Some things that are designed in Desktop, just isn't enough space.
- Such as the navbar, there is not enough white space.
- So we need to **think of a way to still display the information, but still display it effectively.**
	- For the navbar, there will be a hamburger menu.
	- But we will keep the *Login & CTA Button* outside, as this is **Important information.**
- When the component has been converted to tablet, rename it and display it in the design system.

### Hero Section Tablet Design
- You can change the font size and scaling, to give yourself more room.
- Inside the *Typography* Page, under Design System, create another frame, and name it *Tablet Typography*. And all the new text styles you create can go within here.
- Make logical Decisions based on how things look.

### Analytical Section Tablet Design
- Things can collapse into a row, instead a column if it is.

### Exchanges Section Tablet Design:
- Consolidate white space if need, some sacrifices need to be made.

## Start Campaign Tablet Design
- If information is listed as important, and in the desktop it is a 2 column layout, you should include the most important information up the top.

## Contact Us Tablet Design
- If information that is collapsing into another row for space, the content inside can be reconfigured, as there is more space. Such as adding more rows

## Learning Outcome:
1. Create a new page named *Tablet Design*.
2. For each page:
	1. Copy the respective Desktop Mockup into the page.
	2. Create a frame with the correct tablet sizing, and tablet grid.
	3. For each section in each page think like the following:
		1. Resize the respective section, and see if the design visually breaks.
		2. If It does: Think of a way that the information can be displayed in a different way, that fits the new size, and is still visually similar. Example:
			- For the navbar, there is not enough whitespace for the links. So we can add a hamburger menu, and the **non-important**.
