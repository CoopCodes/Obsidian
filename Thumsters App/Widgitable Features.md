# App analysis
## Target audience
- This app is mainly focused around adults, and specifically relationships, long distance ones. 
### Pros
The app has a great concept to bring partners together, both striving to care for their pet/plant. This is enhanced by the widget feature of the app, which they have made their main selling point. As both partners can see their pet on their home screen, they have capitalized on their audience with *mood widgets*. They can extend the functionality of the app with more widgets easily.

### Reviews - <span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically from android users</span>,<span style="font-weight: 1000; color: gold;"> 4.1</span>
#### Supporting
- Love the mood widget, however there can be improvements, and more options to change the moods.
- A couple bugs with connection issues.
- Great app, but most of the features you need *pro* for. Same with buying items for your pets/plants.
- So fun, however the app is confusing to set up in the beginning.
#### Un-supporting
- Users are overall angry about the bugs, a lot of connection issues.
- Cute game, but limited. The mood tracker is useful, but it's annoying that mood customization is locked behind a **paywall** as it makes this protion of the app much less useful and sets it **behind most competitors**. I would enjoy the pet sim aspect more if it was easier (**Or even possible**) to claim more rewards - They are either **paywalled** or they are **unlockable via ads**... Except the ads **won't load** at all for me. 
- I think it is really annoying to have the user wait **24** hours before they can use the app, as the egg needs to hatch.

### Reviews - <span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically from Apple users</span>,<span style="font-weight: 900; color: gold;"> 4.9</span>
#### Supporting
- Overall, most of the reviews are similar to the android reviews, minus the bugs. They complain about the User Experience, and the paywall, but still love the app.
#### Un-supporting
- There are some glitches with the widgets.

### Review analysis
The supporting reviews enjoy the app, but are annoyed about the paywall, and the amount of bugs on the android app, but they have been fixed on the IOS version, thus the much higher rating. Despite the reviews being 4-5 stars. When booting up the app, there is an overwhelming amount of content on the homepage, and it is hard to know where to start, as someone mentioned in the reviews. Our app could improve on this with well thought through **UX** decisions, this specifically needs to be focused on as children will be using it.

The un-supporting reviews still liked the **overall idea**, but were critical on the main things that the supporting reviews were, the **paywall**, **glitches**, and **waiting** for eggs to hatch.

# Overall
## Monetization Strategy
- **Paywall** - The app has a paywall, where **a lot** of the features are hidden. **This is good for monetization, to a certain extent**, if you make too many features paywalled, users who are determined not to pay, will delete the app, which users express in the reviews section.
	- Most items apart from the basic ones, which you have to watch an ad for, are paid, normally around 1-2 dollars per item.
- **Ads** - Ads are used for multiple things, however ads are not available for android users, as it doesn't work:
	- Making eggs hatch faster.
	- Buying items to do actions on your pet/plant, such as food.

This app is great, for apple users. The widget feature is great, so users don't have to open the app to be reminded.
The app is targeted towards adults, so there are relationship features,
