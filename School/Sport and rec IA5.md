There is a syntax error at this line: `Dim powerPointApp As New PowerPoint.Application()`

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

Apologies for the confusion. To resolve the syntax error, you need to add a reference to the PowerPoint Interop library in your Visual Basic project. Here's how you can do it:

1. In Visual Studio, open your project.
2. Right-click on the "References" folder in the Solution Explorer.
3. Select "Add Reference" from the context menu.
4. In the "Reference Manager" window, go to the "COM" tab.
5. Scroll down and locate "Microsoft PowerPoint [Version Number] Object Library".
6. Check the checkbox next to it and click "OK" to add the reference.

After adding the reference, the syntax error should be resolved, and you should be able to create a new PowerPoint application object.
