Hannah Kent in Burial Rites has embedded the powerful concept of redemption all throughout the book. Kent has intentionally fleshed this concept out through several plot events, and vividly defined it through character arcs of many different characters. This is specifically apparent in Agnes, who since birth, has been searching for a place to belong, yet never truly accomplishing it. Her mum left at a young age, her foster mother died later, Natan, her lover, she murdered. Kent has clearly made this pattern of belonging, then abandonment exposed in Agnes's life. Yet, Agnes finally feels like she belongs at Magrets farm, but to complete the pattern, she is ordered to be executed.

Kent intentionally explores this topic of redemption in Toti's relationship with Agnes. After the initial awkwardness in their first meeting, Toti prayed a pre-scripted prayer, and Agnes was not impressed; "I've made a mistake", and asked Toti to leave. Toti left, and later began to research her life at the archive. This showed an actual desire to help from Toti.
