## Example of 1st TEEL paragraph:
Jojo Rabbit’s writer, producer, director, and star, Taika Waititi, refers to the movie as a “anti-hate satire” as contrasted to a “anti-Nazi satire.” (SOURCE?) The film uses Nazi Germany as an analogy for modern-day emotions and politics. It depicts the story of a young, bright German youngster and how he perceived Hitler, the war, and daily life at that time. Viewers are given a thin veil through which to see through the violence in war, indoctrination, and the hatred that ignited and escalated both war and genocide. The seeds were firmly sown in the mind of a tween who was too innocent to comprehend and too eager to follow, all the while seeing the destruction of the world surrounding him—a world which was more complicated than it first appeared. War is a destructive force that brings about unimaginable suffering and devastation. Yet, amidst the chaos, there is always hope. Such is the message conveyed in Steven Galloway's 'The Cellist of Sarajevo.' Inspired by the true story of a cellist who played music in public spaces in memory of bombing victims during the Bosnian War, the novel is a poignant reminder of the resilience of the human spirit in times of crisis. The novel follows the perspectives of four characters, including a hired sniper tasked with defending the cellist, as they navigate the violence and turmoil of the conflict. Through their experiences, the book explores the harrowing reality of war and its devastating impact on the human psyche. In this literary article, we will examine how violence is portrayed in ‘JoJo Rabbit’ & 'The Cellist of Sarajevo' and its impact on the characters' lives.

##### AI Generated:
The concept of conflict, a serious disagreement or argument, is a central theme in Taika Waititi's film, "Jojo Rabbit." The film, which Waititi describes as an "anti-hate satire," uses the backdrop of Nazi Germany to explore the internal conflict experienced by its young protagonist, Jojo. This conflict is primarily represented through Jojo's interactions with his mother and a hidden Jewish girl, and his struggle to reconcile his indoctrinated beliefs about Jews with the reality he encounters.

Jojo's internal conflict is a reflection of the larger societal conflict within Nazi Germany, where citizens were secretly hiding Jews from the oppressive regime. Jojo, having been indoctrinated into the Nazi ideology, initially views Jews as monsters and the war as a game. However, his perspective begins to shift when he discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. This revelation triggers two main conflicts: one between Jojo and his mother, as he disagrees with her decision to hide the girl, and another within Jojo himself, as he grapples with understanding what is right or wrong.
These conflicts are vividly portrayed in the film, particularly in the scene titled "This Table is Switzerland," where Jojo and his mother engage in a heated argument about the ongoing war. This scene encapsulates the tension between Jojo's indoctrinated beliefs and the moral dilemma he faces, effectively illustrating the internal and external conflicts that are central to the film's narrative.
In conclusion, Waititi's "Jojo Rabbit" uses the character of Jojo to represent the concept of conflict, both internal and societal, within the context of Nazi Germany. Through Jojo's interactions and personal struggles, the film provides a nuanced exploration of the complexities of conflict and the impact of indoctrination on individual beliefs and actions.






Jojo Rabbit, directed by Taika Waititi, is a unique and thought-provoking film that masterfully highlights the concept of conflict. Set during World War II, the movie follows the story of Jojo, a young German boy whose imaginary friend is none other than Adolf Hitler himself. This strange and comedic relationship between Jojo and Hitler represents the internal conflict within Jojo's mind. On one hand, he is a loyal member of the Hitler Youth, indoctrinated with Nazi ideology. On the other hand, his encounters with a young Jewish girl named Elsa force him to confront the contradictions and moral dilemmas of his beliefs. This conflict is brilliantly portrayed through the character of Jojo, who represents the confusion and struggle that many individuals faced during this tumultuous period in history.

One way in which Jojo Rabbit represents the concept of conflict is through its juxtaposition of comedy and tragedy. The film seamlessly weaves together humorous moments with darker, more serious undertones. This contrast highlights the conflicting emotions and experiences that Jojo and other characters go through. For example, we see Jojo's initial enthusiasm for the war and his desire to be a loyal Nazi soldier quickly give way to confusion and doubt when he discovers Elsa hiding in his attic. The comedic interactions between Jojo and Hitler serve as a coping mechanism for Jojo's internal struggle, providing a sense of lightheartedness in the midst of a deeply troubling time.

Furthermore, Jojo Rabbit represents conflict through its exploration of identity and belonging. As a young boy growing up in Nazi Germany, Jojo grapples with his own sense of self and where he fits into society. He struggles to reconcile his innate compassion and empathy with the hateful propaganda he has been taught. This internal battle mirrors the external conflict between Nazi ideology and human decency that was prevalent during this era. Through Jojo's journey, the film raises important questions about the nature of identity and the power of empathy in overcoming hatred and prejudice.

In conclusion, Jojo Rabbit skillfully represents the concept of conflict through its portrayal of internal struggles, juxtaposition of comedy and tragedy, and exploration of identity. The film serves as a powerful reminder of the complexities of human nature and the conflicts that arise when ideologies clash. By highlighting these conflicts, Jojo Rabbit prompts viewers to reflect on their own beliefs, values, and capacity for empathy in the face of challenging circumstances.

### Analysis of Inner Moral Conflict in "Schindler's Ark"

**Topic Sentence:**  
The portrayal of inner moral conflict in "Schindler's Ark" is a poignant reflection of the ethical dilemmas faced by the Germans during the Holocaust.

**Evidence:**  
In the film, the character of Oskar Schindler serves as a compelling example of this inner moral conflict. Despite being a member of the Nazi party, Schindler undergoes a transformation as he witnesses the atrocities committed against the Jewish population. His initial opportunistic motives gradually give way to a deep-seated moral awakening, leading him to risk his own safety and wealth to save the lives of over a thousand Jewish individuals.

**Explanation:**  
This transformation of Schindler illustrates the inner turmoil experienced by many Germans who found themselves complicit in or aware of the horrors unfolding around them. Schindler's moral evolution highlights the struggle between individual conscience and societal expectations, as well as the complexity of navigating moral decisions within a deeply oppressive and indoctrinated environment.



Whilst the novel is a fictional depiction of the life and actions of Oscar Schindler, this quote shows why he did it, he didn't like what the Nazis believed. And the Novel represents 

The conflict shown in Jojo Rabbit is a great example of the Moral questions that Germans had during the Nazi Regime. Hitler's promises of hope gave Germans a sense of desperation. And despite Hitler blaming the depression on the Jews, as the awareness of what was happening to them grew, people like Oskar Schindler immediately knew it wasn't right,


The quote, although not a part of the novel, reveals the inner turmoil that many Germans faced during the Nazi regime. They despised the cruelty, the madness, and the inhumanity of Nazism, but they felt powerless to resist or oppose it. They did what they thought they had to do, what their conscience allowed them to do, what their survival demanded them to do. That's all they could do. Schindler, however, was different. He was not a passive bystander, but an active hero. He defied the odds and the dangers to save more than a thousand Jewish lives. His story exposes the contrast between those who acted and those who remained silent in the face of evil.
