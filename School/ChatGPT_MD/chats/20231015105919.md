The video titled "Business Criteria - Scotty breaks it down" discusses the process of evaluating a business's success. The speaker emphasizes four key criteria: competitiveness, effectiveness, efficiency, and stakeholder satisfaction.

1. **Competitiveness**: A successful business needs to offer products or services that meet consumer expectations. This involves studying competitors' strategies closely and staying aware of potential future competition.

2. **Effectiveness**: If a business achieves its goals or objectives, it is considered effective. Effectiveness in business is often seen as a measure of quality.

3. **Efficiency**: Efficiency refers to accomplishing tasks with minimal waste of time and resources. While something can be effective without being efficient (and vice versa), an ideal business strives for both.

4. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Stakeholders may include customers wanting high-quality products at reasonable prices, employees seeking job security and satisfaction, management aiming to achieve business goals, and owners desiring returns on their investments.

The speaker also notes that the stage in the company's lifecycle influences these evaluations; for instance, stakeholders might tolerate lack of profit from a startup but not from a mature company.
 
In conclusion, understanding these four criteria—competitiveness, effectiveness efficiency,and stakeholder satisfaction—is crucial when assessing whether a business is successful or not.
