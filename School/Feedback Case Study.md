Case Study: Providing and Receiving Feedback in an Entry-Level IT Support Role

## Introduction:

You are a new IT support employee at Tech Solutions Inc., a medium-sized IT consulting firm. Your role primarily involves providing technical assistance to clients, troubleshooting software and hardware issues, and ensuring customer satisfaction. You've recently completed your onboarding and training, and now it's time to put your skills to the test. This case study will help you explore the dynamics of providing and receiving feedback in your entry-level IT support role.

## Case Scenario:

One morning, you are assigned to assist a client, Sarah Miller, who is experiencing network connectivity issues. Sarah is the office manager at a small local business, and she's been experiencing frequent disruptions in her internet connection. You need to resolve her issue promptly and provide excellent customer service. Let's analyze the situation, provide and receive feedback:

### Task 1: Providing Feedback

1.1. Before you begin troubleshooting, create a checklist of the steps you plan to follow to diagnose and fix Sarah's network issue. Explain why this checklist is essential.

1. Ask if she has done anything to try and fix it, and ask if it did anything.
2. Try a different website, perhaps the website she was on was down.
3. Try move her device closer to the router. 
4. Ask her to turn of the router, then unplug it from the wall for 30 seconds. She should then plug it back in, and wait 1-2 minutes, and turn on the router.

After waiting until all the "Internet", "Wi-Fi", and "Power" are green, if this doesn't work, continue.
5. Check if all wires are properly connected, the power wires, LAN, and the WLAN wire especially, make sure none are slightly off, and unplug all and re-plug them.
6. Check for an Internet outage online yourself.
7. If none of these steps work, she should call her internet provider, as there could be a problem with her hardware or an NBN wire in her house.

These steps are important as they act like filters, and make sure that the steps are in order to try the most common fix first, then the filtering down.



1.2. After you have resolved Sarah's network connectivity issue, what steps will you take to provide feedback to her regarding the solution and the steps you took to resolve the problem?

Explain the prompts you used to Google to find the right answers, and explain that you created a step by step checklist to make sure a diagnosis was found.

1.3. Why is it important to ensure that Sarah understands the solution and the steps taken to resolve her issue?

As if it occurs again, she knows what to do.

### Task 2: Receiving Feedback

2.1. After providing the solution, Sarah expresses her frustration with the frequent network issues and suggests that the company's IT services should be more proactive in preventing such problems. How should you receive and respond to this feedback?

Thank her for the feedback, and Help her understand that we are just an IT consulting firm. And do not produce the Wi-fi routers. Tell her that you will contact the IT team asking that they will be more proactive.

2.2. To address Sarah's suggestion for more proactive IT services, what steps can you take as an entry-level IT support employee to initiate changes or improvements within the company?

Consult the IT team responsible for the router, and explain how you have had clients complain about it. Give constructive criticism as to how they could fix it. Use better quality hardware, or provide steps to fix Wi-fi in starting guide.

2.3. How can constructive feedback, like Sarah's, contribute to your professional growth in your entry-level IT support role?

Without constructive criticism, it would be a lot harder to improve on things and your skills.


Conclusion:

In this case study, you've explored the dynamics of providing and receiving feedback in an entry-level IT support role. Effective communication and feedback are crucial in ensuring client satisfaction and personal and professional growth. By following the steps provided, you can create a positive client experience and contribute to the ongoing improvement of IT services within your organization.
