- **Good Afternoon**
- **Introduce yourself, and tell them how you are going to explain why they should vote for you.**

Good afternoon, students and teachers.
I'm Cooper Fieldhouse, and I want to tell you why you should do the thing where you tick the box that says you vote for me.

- **School is great but it is lacking applicable information, 'life skills'**
	- **Taxes, changing a tire, prompting Chat GPT to do assessments, and more **
- **I'm gonna bring back life skills a couple times a term**

School is a great place for learning, socialization, sport, and a whole range of other things. but the one thing that i feel that is equally important to learn in school are 'life skills'. After graduating from school there is a whole lot of things that would be beneficial to know - such as taxes, being able to look for work, and even things such as changing a car tire. So I would really try my best to be able to have a 'life skills' class like we used to. And it would be a couple of weeks a term.
And when you get out of school, you will immediately have an advantage over other people from other schools. And our school could be known for producing real-life ready students, who have street smarts.

- **How i miss the practical chapels, giving back to the community**
	- **Giving to mothers in need, stuff like that**
- **How doing this represents the school well**
	- ***"doing it in the name of God and our school represents us as a generous, kind group of people"***

Another thing I miss that school used to have, were those practical chapels, where we would give back to the community. Last time we made shoeboxes of useful items for struggling mothers, and a couple other things. Not only does this help other people, but it makes *you* feel good, which is not the reason we are doing this, but helps. And doing it in the name of God and our school represents us as a generous, kind group of young adults.

- ***"The world is your oyster"*** - **Is my personal motto**
- **How I know that I have so many opportunities to do good in any environment that i am in, that is why I am seizing this opportunity to do school captain**

"The world is your oyster".

- ***"I have been at the school for 12 years, and I love the community"***
- **Talk about how you are grateful that you have this opportunity to serve the community.
- **And will not take it for granted:**
	- Will help with many events to take **stress off of teachers**, and personally organize *Life skills*, and the practical chapel.
- ***"So how is everyone?", "That's great.", but if you aren't:***
	- ***"I want you to know that I can always help you, get the help you need, or just listen."***


Serving this school is something I have wanted to do and I have been extremely passionate about this for the 12 years i have been here, and I'm so grateful for this opportunity. 
if i become school captain i will be personally organizing the life skills class, and practical chapel, and many other school events, like i have in the past. But it's also just as important to me to be someone that you feel you can approach. So if you have any problems, want help, or just need me to listen, i will always be there. I want to be a support to all students, to help everyone on the journey we are all going through. 

I have always felt that as a student of our school, that I have been encouraged and supported by our community and would love the opportunity to be able to represent the school that has been such a wonderful influence in the years that I have been here.
However, no matter what the decision that is made, I will do all that I can to still support whoever is elected as school captain.

- **"But before i finish", Thank everyone, especially mum**
- ***"Thankyou for guiding me through my journey, and bringing me to where i am now."***
- Thank the audience for listening

Before i finish, i just wanted to thank all the amazing teachers we have here, my peers, and especially my mum, who have guided me my whole life, and brought me to the place i am now.

Thankyou for listening.
