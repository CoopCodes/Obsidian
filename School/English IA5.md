- What the conflict is and how it is represented in the film.
- What is the conflict?
	- The main conflict is the **internal** conflict within Nazi Germany. Specifically, citizens hiding jews. This happens in the film, and is seen as the main conflict. Jojo has been indoctrinated into the Nazi regime, and is convinced that jews are monsters. However he does not know the actual horror of the Nazi Regime, all the propaganda he has seen has hid him from that, he finds it like a game.
	- When He finds the jew that his mum is hiding, the 2 main conflicts begin:
		- Conflict between him and his mum, he doesn't think that the jew should be hidden. 
		- Conflict within himself, he doesn't know what is right or wrong.
- How it is represented in the film.
	- A great instance of the conflict between Jojo and his mum is in the [This Table is Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UwW2p2GjbM) scene. Where they argue about the war going on.

*"Get your shit together and sort out your priorities. You're 10 Jojo, start acting like it."* World War II provoked countless conflicts throughout the world, to many to mention. In the Film Jojo Rabbit, the director, Taika Waititi chooses to focus on 2 main conflicts, the conflict within The protagonist, Jojos' mind, and the conflict with Jojo and his mother. Which is arguably a representation & reflection of the internal conflict within Germany at the time. Jojo has an imaginary friend, who is none other than Adolf Hitler himself, or what Jojo thinks he is.
Throughout the film, Jojo goes from a Patriotic Nazi, to a boy grounded in reality, scarred physically and mentally, this is a result of Jojo's internal conflict. Waititi visualizes this conflict literally, with Jojo and Hitler, which is a creation of Jojos own mind. A key scene that highlights this conflict is the second last time Hitler is seen. Hitler is vividly shown yelling at Jojo when he amused the thought of her being "nice". The quote *"Get your shit together and sort out your priorities. You're 10 Jojo, start acting like it."*, effectively captures the essence of this scene, there is war going on inside his mind, one side has compassion, and the other, unnaturally implanted by propaganda and entertained by his childish mind. The idea that Hitler is a figment of his imagination is further reinforced by the satirical and ironic sentence at the end of the quote *"You're 10 Jojo, start acting like it."*. Jojo thinks that at 10 you are supposed to be a man, he is hard on himself, which originates from the Nazi propaganda, making boys think they are men, giving them guns and grenades.
This internal conflict is symbolic of the conflict within Nazi Germany, *The Resistance*, whom Jojos Mother, Rosie was apart of. When they resist, they get shut down, just like Imaginary Hitler is doing to Jojo. This conflict within Germany is further explored in the novel "Schindler's Ark" (Keneally, 1982) where the story of how a business man named Oskar Schindler used his status and wealth to protect the lives of his Jewish workers. 



#### 2nd TEEL Body Paragraph:
___
*// Explain how Thomas represents the internal conflict of Germany through the story of Oskar Schindler* 
___
- *"There was no choice. If you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car, wouldn’t you help him?"*
- There was no choice. If you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car, wouldn't you help him?
    - To Poldek Pfefferberg, in response to the question of why he risked so much, as quoted in "Schindler: Why did he do it?" (2010) by Louis Bülow.

##### Schindler's Reasoning
I hated the brutality, the sadism, and the insanity of Nazism. I just couldn't stand by and see people destroyed. I did what I could, what I had to do, what my conscience told me I must do. That's all there is to it. 



The conflict within Jojo portrayed in Jojo rabbit is a great representation of the wider German population. Germany was coming out of an economical depression (_Great Depression_, 2024), and Hitler gave them hope, but some of them began to question the moral implications of what they were doing, especially with the Jews. This internal conflict that was happening was thoroughly exposed in the novel, *"Schindler's Ark" (1982)*. Where the story of a man, Oskar Schindler, who saved 1,200 Jews from the Holocaust (_Oskar Schindler_, 2023). The Novel explores the reality of life in those times *"life did not have the value of a pack of cigarettes", Oskar Schindler*, and through the telling of Schindler's story, the conflict going on inside Germans was exposed.
*"I hated the brutality, the sadism, and the insanity of Nazism. I just couldn't stand by and see people destroyed. I did what I could, what I had to do, what my conscience told me I must do. That's all there is to it."* (_Oscar Schindler, Why_, 2010).
Whilst this quote is not directly from the novel, it illustrates what a lot of complicit Germans felt during those times, but did nothing to help. Schindler was not complicit, and risked his life to save 1000+ Jews. During the Novel, Keneally tells the brief story of a Jew, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, who is the maid of a man Amon Göth. She was beat almost daily by the man. During a high-up dinner, Schindler met the woman, and he kissed her *"Out of pity", "I'm kissing you out of pity."* Keneally excellently portrays Schindler's Solemn pity, and empathy for the woman, you can almost picture the scene, and feel the emotions they can. This would be the first time Schindler is shown overcoming the conflict he may have felt, *"He'd try to get her out"*. <span Where he knew that he would get her out no matter the cost, his empathy had overcome the sense of self-preservation. Keneally would show Schindler do similar things many times in the novel. Whilst Schindler had the right combination of power and empathy to achieve this, a lot of Germans did not, and the sense of self-preservation overcame the empathy they may have felt.
Schindler's Ark represents the reality of what the Jews felt, through the story of Helen, and highlights the deep emotions of what Germans may have felt for them, illustrated by the context of Schindler's life leading up to this moment, and deep, vivid visualizations of the scenes where he offers to save them.


#### 3rd TEEL Body Paragraph:
___
*// Compare and contrast how are these representations different? Similar? How do they contribute to how we feel/think/talk about war?* 
___


Jojo Rabbit a modern day representation of the conflicts that every-day Germans faced in those times, and used many different symbolisms. The one discussed in the article being, the symbolism of Fake Hitler, and the war/conflict going on in Jojos mind. The film highlights the transformation of Jojo being a Nazi, to a boy grounded in reality, and portrays the conflict that occurs during this transformation. This conflict within Jojo is a great representation of wider German population, and how they may be feeling. This internal conflict is further explored and represented in the Novel "*Schindler's Ark*", where the author, Keneally, walks the reader through Schindler's story of overcoming the internal conflict, empathy winning over self-preservation. 

### Conclusion:
___
*// A conclusion that relates back to the article's central idea and leaves a lasting impression on readers.*
___

These two texts combined expose how Germany was riddled with conflict, internal and external. Jojo rabbit visualizes the internal conflict that may go on inside a German, through the depiction of fake Hitler, and conflict that ensues in those scenes. Schindler's Ark expands on this, and rather than depicting this conflict symbolically, it is depicted literally. This is achieved by Keneally through the story-telling of Schindler's life, and the vivid visualizations of scenes where he shows genuine empathy for the victims. These two *Perspectives* together represent conflict to the reader, and effectively communicate the solemnity of the Holocaust.

# Final:
Conflict is something that has plagued humanity for all recorded history, and has been described in countless texts, and portrayed from many different perspectives and opinions. One of the worst conflicts in modern history, the Nazi Regime and the Holocaust, has been rigorously documented from many people who experienced it. Stories from this tragic era have been repeatedly recounted in modern times. Two of these texts, "Jojo Rabbit" (Waititi, 2016), and "Schindler's Ark" (Keneally, 1982) highlight how the author/director of each texts represents conflict through the re-telling of events in the Holocaust and the overall Nazi Regime.

"Get your shit together and sort out your priorities. You're 10 Jojo, start acting like it." World War II provoked countless conflicts throughout the world, to many to mention. In the film Jojo Rabbit, the director, Taika Waititi, chooses to focus on two main conflicts, the conflict within the protagonist, Jojos' mind (the ethical dilemma if killing Jewish people is ethical), and the conflict with Jojo and his mother. Which is arguably a representation and reflection of the internal conflict within Germany at the time. Jojo has an imaginary friend, who is none other than Adolf Hitler himself, or what Jojo thinks he would be like. Throughout the film, Jojo was transformed from a Patriotic Nazi, to a boy grounded in reality, scarred physically and mentally. This is a result of Jojo's internal conflict. Waititi visualizes this conflict literally, with Jojo and Hitler, which is a figment of Jojo's imagination. A key scene that highlights this conflict is seen, Hitler is vividly shown yelling at Jojo when he amused the thought of her being "nice". The quote effectively captures the essence of this scene, there is war going on inside his mind, one side has compassion, and the other, unnaturally implanted by propaganda and entertained by his childish mind. The idea that Hitler is a figment of his imagination is further reinforced by the satirical and ironic sentence at the end of the quote, "You're 10 Jojo, start acting like it.". Jojo thinks that at 10 you are supposed to be a man, he is hard on himself, which originates from the Nazi propaganda, making boys think they are men, giving them guns and grenades. This internal conflict is symbolic of the conflict within Nazi Germany, the rebel group, The Resistance, whom Jojo's Mother, Rosie, was a part of. When they resist, they get murdered, and hung in the street, just like Imaginary Hitler is doing to Jojo. This conflict within Germany is further explored in the novel "Schindler's Ark" (Keneally, 1982) where the story of how a business man named Oskar Schindler used his status and wealth to protect the lives of his Jewish workers.

The conflict within Jojo portrayed in Jojo rabbit is a great representation of the wider German population. Germany was coming out of an economic depression (Great Depression, 2024), and Hitler gave them hope, but some of them began to question the moral implications of what they were doing, especially with the Jews. This internal conflict that was happening was thoroughly exposed in the novel, "Schindler's Ark" (1982). Where the story of a man, Oskar Schindler, who saved 1,200 Jews from the Holocaust (Oskar Schindler, 2023). The novel explores the reality of life in those times "life did not have the value of a pack of cigarettes", this quote is referencing the cost of a human (Jewish) life being worthless. Oskar Schindler, and through the telling of Schindler's story, the conflict going on inside the hearts of Germans was exposed. "I hated the brutality, the sadism, and the insanity of Nazism. I just couldn't stand by and see people destroyed. I did what I could, what I had to do, what my conscience told me I must do. That's all there is to it." (Oscar Schindler, Why, 2010). This illustrates what a lot of complicit Germans felt during those times, but did nothing to help. Schindler was not complicit, and risked his life to save 1000+ Jewish people. During the novel, Keneally tells the brief story of a Jewish woman, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, who is the maid of Amon Göth. She was beat almost daily by the man. During a German Nationalistic dinner, Schindler met the woman, and he kissed her "Out of pity", "I'm kissing you out of pity." Keneally excellently portrays Schindler's Solemn pity. This would be the first time Schindler is shown overcoming the conflict he may have felt, "He'd try to get her out". Where he knew that he would get her out no matter the cost, his empathy had overcome the sense of self-preservation. Keneally depicts Schindler doing similar things many times in the novel. Whilst Schindler had the right combination of power and empathy to achieve this, a lot of Germans did not, and the sense of self-preservation overcame the empathy they may have felt. "Whoever saves one life, saves the entire world". Schindler's Ark represents the reality of what the Jewish felt, as exemplified through the story of Helen, and highlights the deep emotions of what Germans may have felt for them, illustrated by the context of Schindler's life leading up to this moment, and deep, vivid visualizations of the scenes where he offers to save them. This novel along with the film Jojo Rabbit depicts Nazi Germany as a solemn place of conflict, where people either have internal conflict, or conflict towards the Jewish people, and the whole world.

Jojo Rabbit is a modern day representation of the conflicts that every-day humans faced in those times, the article discusses the use of various symbolisms, with a focus on the symbolism of Fake Hitler and the war/conflict occurring in Jojo's mind. The film highlights the transformation of Jojo being a Nazi, to a boy grounded in reality, and portrays the conflict that occurs during this transformation. This conflict within Jojo is a great representation of the wider German population, and how they may be feeling. This internal conflict is further explored and represented in the novel "Schindler's Ark", where the author, Keneally, walks the reader through Schindler's story of overcoming the internal conflict, empathy winning over self-preservation. 

These two texts combined expose how Germany was riddled with conflict, both internal and external. Jojo Rabbit visualizes the internal conflict that may go on inside the minds of people, through the depiction of imaginary Hitler, and the conflict that ensues in those scenes. Schindler's Ark also contributes to this conversation, and rather than depicting this conflict symbolically, it is portrayed literally. This is achieved by Keneally through the story-telling of Schindler's life, and the vivid language used of scenes where he shows genuine empathy for the victims. These two perspectives together represent conflict to the reader, and effectively communicate the solemnity of the Holocaust.
