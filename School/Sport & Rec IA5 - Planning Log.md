*// Instructions*

Due to all the players being previously experienced with basketball, we can skip base basketball drills.
1. Start off with getting players to jump around on the trampolines, just to warm up.
2. Get all players to practice stand-still dunks, 10 dunks per person, line up. *Trampolines can be hard to use, this helps built agility for the players, and connect their previous skills with basketball, to trampolines.*
3. Get players to dunk from the outer trampolines, jumping from the outer tramps -> inner tramps -> dunking. 10 per player.
4. Get players to pair up, and get the pairs to stand on the trampoline under the rim (pairs can rotate), and get 1 player from each pair to dunk on the other one. 5 per person, and swap to other partner for another 5. *This helps with defense, blocking shots, it is very hard to time when to block as you have so much air time.*
5. Same thing as above, but both players in the pairs get a run up (dunker from half court, and blocker from side of the court).
6. End with a game between all players, make sure all players are aware of the rules.
 
*// Feedback*

- Provide feedback on how to jump better on trampolines.
- If a player messes up, give positive feedback, and walk them through ways to improve.

*// Motivation*

- Due to the sport being a very active sport, and the focus is on fun. The drills will motivate the players to build their skills, as not only is it building to better skills for a game, but it is enjoyable.

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning    | - Clear structure and progression of activities.<br>- Specific focus on integrating basketball skills with trampoline use.<br>- Adequate warm-up with trampoline familiarization.                           | - May not account for varying skill levels in trampoline proficiency.<br>- No contingency plan for injuries or equipment failure.<br>- Limited time for each activity may rush players' learning process.               |
| Intructions | - Instructions build on existing basketball skills.<br>- Progressive difficulty of drills enhances skill development.<br>- Encourages player interaction and peer learning in pairs.                        | - Instructions may not be detailed enough for trampoline novices.<br>- Lack of detailed safety instructions given the increased risk.<br>- May not provide enough guidance for defensive skills on trampolines.         |
| Relevance   | - Drills are directly relevant to the skills needed in a Slamball game.<br>- Focus on agility and dunking aligns with the excitement of Slamball.<br>- Defense and blocking drills mimic in-game scenarios. | - Some players may not find stand-still dunks challenging enough.<br>- Relevance to game situations could be improved with more varied drills.<br>- May not cover all aspects of the game, such as passing or shooting. |
| Feedback    | - Positive reinforcement encourages player engagement.<br>- Immediate feedback helps correct technique on the spot.<br>- Feedback on trampoline jumping is specific to Slamball's unique aspect.            | - Feedback might be too general and not tailored to individual needs.<br>- Limited time for individual feedback due to the number of participants.<br>- Could benefit from more structured feedback sessions.           |
