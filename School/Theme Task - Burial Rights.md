# Redemption
## 5 Examples
1. When Toti came back after being rejected by Agnes

The first time Toti came to help "save" Agnes, and she eventually rejected him, saying that "She made a mistake", of wanting him there. 
He came back after a couple of weeks, after his father asked *"Does she pray?"*; Determined to help her. And he said the right things, and she wanted him to keep coming again.

2. Agnes and Margret's reconciliation.

*What sort of woman kills men?*  
*The only murderesses Margrét had known were the women in the sagas, and even then, it was with words that they had killed men; orders given to servants to slay lovers or avenge the death of kin. Those women murdered from a distance and kept their fingers clean. But these times are not saga times…This woman is not a saga woman.*
This quote highlights her hatred and pre-disposed judgement of Agnes, a women-murderer. And it takes a long time 

3. The redemption of her humanity before she dies, with Margret giving her nice things to wear before it.

4. Siggas' selfish redemption.

I’ll tell you something, Reverend Tóti. All my life people have thought I was too clever…That’s exactly why they don’t pity me. Because they think I’m too smart… to get caught up in this by accident. But Sigga is dumb and pretty and young, and that is why they don’t want to see her die…They see I’ve got a head on my shoulders, and believe a thinking woman cannot be trusted. Believe there’s no room for innocence. And like it or not, Reverend, that is the truth of it.

“Why not Sigga?” Tóti asked in a small voice.  
Blöndal shook his head. “The maid of sixteen who burst into tears as soon as I summoned her? Sigga didn’t even attempt to lie—she is too simple-minded, too young to know how. She told me everything. How Agnes hated Natan, how Agnes was jealous of his attentions to her. Sigga is not bright, but she saw that much.”

5. Agnes's popularity redemption after she died, with the re-trial, and eventually the book Burial Rights.
