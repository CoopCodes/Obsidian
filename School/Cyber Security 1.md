Please do the following:  
- View the class recording: [Certificate III IT Nov Traineeship Lecture Link-20231113_080927-Meeting Recording.mp4](https://tafeqld-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/montanna_chisnall_tafeqld_edu_au/EXc3JyXzxDZJqM6FJF9IozYByic6xCy-kqWMrBsfAhHyqw?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZyIsInJlZmVycmFsQXBwUGxhdGZvcm0iOiJXZWIiLCJyZWZlcnJhbE1vZGUiOiJ2aWV3In19&e=CyFHva)
- View Thales. (2018). _A long day (with no cybersecurity)._ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYXdTIwdkj0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYXdTIwdkj0)
A fun but potentially realistic look at a world with no cybersecurity for your viewing.
- [x] Consider how you would define the term “cyber security”. Note why you believe it’s important.
**Cyber security is the way you protect yourself from other people accessing you're private information, and digital belongings. Just like how you have a door on your house.**

- [ ] Review the TAFE Cyber Threats Learner Guide in Connect: Please look at module 1 pages including “introduction”, “phishing”, “social engineering”, “social media” and “malware”. Please note the different types of threats discussed, and what they are in your own words. The following link will also be useful to your learning for a definition of cyber security, its importance and definitions of common cyber threats: Cisco. (2023). _What is Cyber Security?_ [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html)


- [x] Review Australian Government. (n.d.). _Threats_. [https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats#types](https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats#types)

Take the “spot the scam” quiz to identify examples of the phishing threat in action, and test your cyber threat identification skills. Please note that this is not an assessment, but is just a fun application of your knowledge.

- [x] Please research online through Google one new, emerging or current cyber threat that interests you, and please email your teacher with a short paragraph on what the threat is, how it works and how it can impact a business or others.


**LLMs in Phishing. With the development of LLMs, scammers that use phishing as a technique to spread malware, adware, trojans, and worms, are being recognized more with people having more education around phishing. However with the rise of next to free tools such as ChatGPT, they can use it to create even more personalized emails, thus it is getting harder and harder for people to recognize these attacks.**

I hope you have enjoyed this first week learning about major cyber threats. Next week we will be looking at practices to help reduce these threats.
