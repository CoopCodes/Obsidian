# 1: Introduction 
"Hell is one of the most misunderstood concepts of Christian theology, both by those within the religion, and by those outside of it. This misrepresentation of Hell not only does damage to the image of the Christian Church, but also causes some of the faithful, themselves, to fall away from what they perceive to be a monstrous God." (_What You Know about Hell Is Wrong_, 2022). Hell is a massively misrepresented part of Christianity. This misrepresentation derives from the money-driven Roman Catholics, and is this outdated, manipulated belief is something a lot of non-Christian people think. And, in fact it is one of the biggest obstacle that stops people from wanting to believe in God.

1 Timothy 4:9
1 Timothy 2:6
