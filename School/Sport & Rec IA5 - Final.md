# Introduction
## Identify
**Basketball** is an extremely popular sport among youth throughout the whole world, but mostly western society. In Australia it is the 7th most popular sport among children (ranked by Participation rate). One of the biggest reasons for its popularity is its flexibility to work almost all aspects of physical and mental game, hand eye coordination, speed, athleticism, game IQ, and so much more. Basketball has increased popularized over the years due the NBA growing in popularity. One of the most enjoyable parts of basketball is dunking, and jumping high, and the aggressiveness of it. This is why **SlamBall** was created, it takes the high-jumping, high-adrenaline part of basketball, and turns it up to 100.

## Describe
**SlamBall** famously has 4 trampolines underneath each basket, this enables players to jump 3x the amount in normal basketball, and dunking is more accessible for shorter players, unlike basketball. It is also a *contact sport*, and tackling below the neck & above the waist is allowed. **Overall**, SlamBall has 4 main modifications:
- Trampolines
- Contact
- Body armor.
- Score, dunks are worth 3 points, beyond the arc (3 point line) is 4 points, jump shots within arc 2 points.

### Timeline
```timeline
[line-3, body-2]
+ 1999
+ Idea of SlamBall
+ Mason Gordon drew out the concept for SlamBall on a napkin. The idea was inspired by basketball video games line "NBA Jam" and "NBA Street". "The TV producer imagined a full-contact basketball-football hybrid amplified by trampolines — sorry, “springbeds” or “tramps,” as Gordon will quickly correct you." (_Greenberg_, 2023)

+ 1999 - </br>2002
+ The original SlamBall
+ Originally SlamBall was pre-taped from a Los Angeles studio, and cut down to a 30 minute show to be shown on SpikeTV.

+ 2004
+ Going from pre-recorded to live.
+ Pre-recording games wasn't what the business owners wanted, they were set on doing live games. However, when they couldn't convince Spike, slamball was shut down.

+ 2008
+ A momentary revival in 2008
+ A momentary revival of slamball occured in 2008, with CBS airing a full season of the sport. 

+ 2023
+ Fifteen years later
+ When the hash tag *#BringBackSlamBall* started to trend on social media, the business partners started a funding round, where several investors raised $11 million dollars. This means they could fund another season for 2023, right after the NBA finals, to direct the most possible NBA viewers to the sport.

### Barrier
##### Basketball Barriers
- Easier for taller people, there is a huge skill gap for tall people and short people, if you are short you have to jump high to be successful.
- Boring for basketball viewers who don't understand basketball.

##### How SlamBall overcame
- The trampolines make it so people of all height can dunk, in fact it is harder for taller people to dunk, as they tend to be less athletic and slow.
- SlamBall is just constant action, dunking, and physical contact, and easy for viewers to understand and enjoy.

# Slamball drill session - planning log

*// Name or description of activity*

## Slamball
A modified version of basketball, that brings all the adrenaline out of basketball, and ups it by 10. It achieves this by placing 4 trampolines under.

*// Participants*

15 - 17 year-old.

*// Equipment*

- 1 basketball per player.
- A SlamBall court.

*// Layout of the activity*

![[Slamball Layout]]

*// Duration of the activity*

30 minutes

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div style="margin-top: 50px;"></div>


*// Instructions*

Due to all the players being previously experienced with basketball, we can skip base basketball drills.
1. Start off with getting players to jump around on the trampolines, just to warm up.
2. Get all players to practice stand-still dunks, 10 dunks per person, line up. *Trampolines can be hard to use, this helps built agility for the players, and connect their previous skills with basketball, to trampolines.*
3. Get players to dunk from the outer trampolines, jumping from the outer tramps -> inner tramps -> dunking. 10 per player.
4. Get players to pair up, and get the pairs to stand on the trampoline under the rim (pairs can rotate), and get 1 player from each pair to dunk on the other one. 5 per person, and swap to other partner for another 5. *This helps with defense, blocking shots, it is very hard to time when to block as you have so much air time.*
5. Same thing as above, but both players in the pairs get a run up (dunker from half court, and blocker from side of the court).
6. End with a game between all players, make sure all players are aware of the rules.
 
*// Feedback*

- Provide feedback on how to jump better on trampolines.
- If a player messes up, give positive feedback, and walk them through ways to improve.

*// Motivation*

- Due to the sport being a very active sport, and the focus is on fun. The drills will motivate the players to build their skills, as not only is it building to better skills for a game, but it is enjoyable.

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning    | - Clear structure and progression of activities.<br>- Specific focus on integrating basketball skills with trampoline use.<br>- Adequate warm-up with trampoline familiarization.                           | - May not account for varying skill levels in trampoline proficiency.<br>- No contingency plan for injuries or equipment failure.<br>- Limited time for each activity may rush players' learning process.               |
| Intructions | - Instructions build on existing basketball skills.<br>- Progressive difficulty of drills enhances skill development.<br>- Encourages player interaction and peer learning in pairs.                        | - Instructions may not be detailed enough for trampoline novices.<br>- Lack of detailed safety instructions given the increased risk.<br>- May not provide enough guidance for defensive skills on trampolines.         |
| Relevance   | - Drills are directly relevant to the skills needed in a Slamball game.<br>- Focus on agility and dunking aligns with the excitement of Slamball.<br>- Defense and blocking drills mimic in-game scenarios. | - Some players may not find stand-still dunks challenging enough.<br>- Relevance to game situations could be improved with more varied drills.<br>- May not cover all aspects of the game, such as passing or shooting. |
| Feedback    | - Positive reinforcement encourages player engagement.<br>- Immediate feedback helps correct technique on the spot.<br>- Feedback on trampoline jumping is specific to Slamball's unique aspect.            | - Feedback might be too general and not tailored to individual needs.<br>- Limited time for individual feedback due to the number of participants.<br>- Could benefit from more structured feedback sessions.           |
