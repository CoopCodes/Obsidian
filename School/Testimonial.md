#### Name, what are you into?
- Cooper.
- I love to do website design, graphic design, and programming. 

#### The early years ……where did you grow up as a kid?
- I grew up in Coffs Harbor, down south. 

#### What are some hurdles you had to work through?
- Before I begin, I just want to thank my mum, without her I would never be able to be in the place that I am at right now. No one else could do what she has done.
- As most of you know, due to all my jokes about it, ==I don't have a dad.==
	- And this mean that it was ==mostly just me and mum== during my childhood, which was hard, ==seeing her struggle== and her not having someone there to help. 
	- I especially found it hard during these last couple years ==when she got injured==, and there ==was no partner to help her, and i had to step up==.
- <u>Another big thing i dealt with, which most teenage boys go through</u>, was ==temptation==, and the crippling guilt you feel when you give in. And the only person who ==really warned me== about it was ==my mum==, and i didn't want to talk to her about it, ==I had no dad to talk to==, and i thought if i talked to an ==adult they would shame me==. So i talked to no one. 
	- But i just want to let all the young men here know that ==you're not alone==, ==WHAT YOU THINK IS WRONG==, you have your <u>friends</u>, your <u>pastors</u>, me, who have ==gone through the exact same thing==, and can help you through it.

#### How do you think these hardships have shaped who you are?
- I have a great analogy for this, so when you ==work out, you are actually destroying, tearing your muscles==, and you're ==body builds more muscle over it==, and this is what makes you stronger.
- The same is with hardships, they destroy your spiritual, and mental muscles, but you ==WILL grow back stronger,== especially with Jesus. ==And this does not discount the tragic, horrible things i know that people here have gone through, but the most righteous and mature people i know, have gone through the most, My Mum, Peter, Pr. Lachie, Pr. Matt.==
	- With hardship you will be more <u>resilience, compassionate, and most importantly be able to empathize with, and help others going through the same thing. </u>
	- Like i wouldn't be able to help the young men in here if i hadn't gone through what i did.

#### Why did you get baptized? 
- One of my ==favorite songs is Good Good Father==, and ==God is the only being in the whole universe that i could sing that to==. He is my father, and ==reading the bible i develop a relationship with him==, and learn his ==values==, compassion, humbleness, love. And I want him to be my anchor because by trying my best to stick to his values, and i know that if i fail, he is merciful. If he is my anchor i will not become an ==unloving person==. 


<hr style="background: #FF6961; height: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">

#### Why did you not blame God?
- During those times it was so hard not to, but now I realize ==God is using me to help others through similar situations==, and without those hardships i wouldn't be the person I am now.
- And since my ==baptism I've been reading the word every morning==, and I know everyone talks about how good it is, but it really is amazing, ==God removed my temptations==, and shown me how to be a *good man*, where no father could teach me. 


<hr style="background: #FF6961; height: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">

- Got is using me to help others
- I've read the word every morning.
- This removed all my temptations.

#### Favorite Bible Verse or Passage
- 1 Corinthians 13 Is a chapter ==I try my best to live by==, it talks about love, and how ==nothing else you do matters, if you do not love==. And i just want to encourage everyone today, make ==every interaction you have in your life, a loving interaction.== , smile as you walk past people, ==be nice to your friends when you get to school==. I know ==so many people have not loved you==, but now's the change to break that chain, and be the difference.
- Also James 5:11, which just popped into my mind one day miraculously.
