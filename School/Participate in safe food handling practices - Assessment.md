A group of new employees will be starting work in your establishment. They have very little experience or pre-existing knowledge of food safety programs and the hygiene legislation that must be complied with at such an establishment. You have been asked to provide their initial training.

What would you tell them about?

1. The relevant information found in the organization’s food safety program (HACCP or other authorized food plan).

- Hazard analysis - Identifying potential hazards in the food preparation process that could cause contamination.
- Critical Control Points - Specified points in the food production where hazards might be able to be reduced or eliminated. If a CCP is done incorrectly it can lead to cross-contamination.
- Critical Limits: finding a max and min limits, for example finding the max and min temperature of a specific food during preparation.
- Monitoring - Steps that are made to monitor Critical control points, and to make sure they are under control, and within the critical limits. For example, checking each piece of chicken cooked so that they meet at least an inside temp of 73 degrees, check with a clean probe.
- Corrective actions: actions to correct if a Critical limit hasn't been reached, for example if the chicken is less than 73 degrees, then a corrective action would be to cook it longer.

**Implementation to fake organization - Egg sandwich shop**

1. Hazard Analysis:

- Raw egg contamination
- Undercooked meat in sandwiches
- Dirty cutting boards
- Staff not washing hands

2. Critical Control Points (CCPs): a) Cooking eggs b) Cooking meat for sandwiches c) Cleaning and sanitizing cutting boards d) Hand washing
3. Critical Limits: a) Eggs must reach internal temp of 64°C for 15 seconds b) Meat must reach internal temp of  71°C for 20 seconds c) Cutting boards must be washed, rinsed, and sanitized after each use d) Staff must wash hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water
4. Monitoring: a) Check egg temperature with a clean thermometer b) Use a meat thermometer to check sandwich meat temperature c) Use a checklist to track cutting board cleaning d) Manager watches staff wash hands
5. Corrective Actions: a) If eggs aren't hot enough, cook them longer b) If meat isn't hot enough, keep cooking until it reaches the right temperature c) If cutting boards aren't cleaned properly, clean them again d) If staff don't wash hands correctly, make them do it again and give more training


2. Critical control points that must be followed to monitor food safety.

- Receiving of stock: you must inspect the food deliveries for temperature and quality when arriving.
- Cooking: Make sure the food reaches the appropriate internal temperature to kill bad pathogens.
- Cooling and storage: Keep an eye on temperatures during storage and/or cooling to stop bacterial growth.

3. Safe and hygienic handling, preparing, processing and storage of food.

- Regularly wash hands, and use gloves.
- Use separate utensils/equipment/surfaces for raw and cooked foods.
- Keep food stored at the required temperatures in clean, sealed containers to keep the food fresh and safe.

4. Temperature control of different food storage areas.

- **Cold storage**: Perishable foods must be stored less than or equal to 5°C to stop bacterial growth.
- **Hot storage**: Hot foods need to be kept at 60°C or more.
- **Freezing**: -18°C or less is required for frozen food to stay frozen solid, and stop bacterial growth.

5. Methods of safely displaying different types of food items.

- Serve food as soon as ready, don't prepare the food too early before service times.
- All self-serve food have to be protected by sneeze guards, and cold food must be packed in ice and/or kept in fridge cabinets.
- Place separate utensils (clean) for each food that is on display, or you can give other methods of dispensing food that stops the food from being contaminated.
- Dispose of single use items once used.
- Only use packaging/wrapping material that is clean.
- Regularly refresh display foods with fresh one, and don't reuse leftover food.
- Make sure that the menus highlight common allergies to ingredients.
- The cabinets, freezers, holding areas/equipment, and bain-maries must be regularly cleaned.

6. Methods that should be followed to rotate stock and dispose of old, contaminated or unusable stock.

Rotation of stock - Rotation of stocks ensures that the quality of the stock is always the best, and that there is no old food being sold. By not rotating the stock you can risk contamination or wastage.

**First in first out**:
- Old stock must be moved to the front of the shelving on which it is placed, and the new stock is in the back. However, this method may make some stock at the front be removed from the shelf, to make room for new stock to be placed behind it.
- Golden rule: **Make sure old stock is used first, before it becomes outdated.**
- When rearranging/restocking, remove any unsuitable or damaged items. And dispose properly

7. Methods that might be used to report non-compliance with the food safety plan and with legislation.

- Documenting incidents in a log/report in order to give details about the non-compliance.
- Talk to your managers/supervisors.

8. Corrective actions that might be taken.
9. Cleaning procedures that must be followed to ensure environmental hygiene.

- Sanitize and clean surfaces, equipment and utensils regularly to remove dirt and bacteria.
- Use reusable containers to some the accumulation of garbage.
- Keep a cleaning roster and monitor it to make sure that cleanings are done consistently.

10. Methods that should be followed to dispose of damaged equipment, utensils etc.

<div style="margin-top: 50px;"></div>


Methods to dispose of damaged equipment/utensils:
1. Find and report any damaged or unsafe items for disposal.
2. Make sure that items are marked and separated from the usable items to stop cross-contamination.
3. Document the repair history of these items, including what was wrong, and how it was fixed.

11. Pest and vermin control procedures to be followed and methods of managing waste.

**Pests:**
To keep pests out of kitchens, food storage, rubbish storage, and food preparation areas, you should:
- Clean the areas well.
- Keep the lid of bins.
- If it's very bad, call pest control.
- Clean & sanitize bins regularly.
- Do not let in any animals to the premise.

**Waste management:**
Waste should be separated into: Plastic, paper, glass, food waste, and metal.
- Soft food scraps should be put in a sinkerator (waste disposal).
- Garbage compactors and grease traps must be cleaned regularly cleaned.
- Oils and fats cannot enter drains or put through garbage compactors.
- Office paper can be shredded, and then recycled.
- Plastic items and cardboard packaging must be compacted for disposal and pickup.
- Recyclable items should be organized for regular pickups.
