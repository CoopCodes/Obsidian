To find the tangent to the equation y = x^2 at the point (1, 3), we need to find the slope of the tangent line and then use the point-slope form of a linear equation.

1. Find the derivative of the equation y = x^2 with respect to x. The derivative of x^2 is 2x.

2. Substitute x = 1 into the derivative to find the slope at x = 1. The slope at x = 1 is 2(1) = 2.

3. Use the point-slope form of a linear equation, y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is the point (1, 3) and m is the slope we found in step 2.

   y - 3 = 2(x - 1)

4. Simplify the equation:

   y - 3 = 2x - 2

5. Rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b:

   y = 2x + 1

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to y = x^2 at the point (1, 3) is y = 2x + 1.
