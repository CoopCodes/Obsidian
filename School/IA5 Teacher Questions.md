The above questions were posed to people at the swimming carnival event. 
### Coopers Role
My role was to record other members of our class doing their job, for example. There were several helpers in the pool, swimming alongside the swimmers, I recorded them doing it, and sent it to them online. 
Once I had footage of everyone doing their jobs, I hopped in the pool to help as well.

Please write an example response for each question acting as if you were a student in my class at the event, whom i recorded video evidence for their assessment on the day. keep each response short, include one criticism. The responder you are imitating is a male. Here is a quick rundown of what i did on the day.
