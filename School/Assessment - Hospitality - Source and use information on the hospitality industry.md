### Career opportunities
With the rise of the internet there is a decreasing need for prerequisite qualifications, as the information taught in educational facilities, can often be found online for free. Anyone can find online recipes and videos to teach them how to create beautiful, tasty meals.

### Relationship between other related industries
Tourism and hospitality are close industries. Tourism involves traveling pleasure, or business. Hospitality, on the other hand, includes services like accommodation, food, and beverages, which are essential for tourists. Hotels, restaurants, and transportation services are important parts of both industries, as the tourists need to stay somewhere, and eat something.

### Compliance issues and quality assurance
Many hospitality businesses are adopting technology solutions to better compliance and quality assurance processes. This includes automated monitoring systems, digital checklists, and data analytics tools.
