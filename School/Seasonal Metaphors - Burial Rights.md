# Winter

- Agnes has no choice but to "Take up the wind's howl and mimic its loneliness"
- Ice and saw isolates the communities in winter.
- Redirecting harshly judgmental values of Blandale and society that doesn't tolerate waywardness.
- The farm animals are killed at the beginning of Winter, to keep a supply of food for winter. This is symbolic of her death also being in winter.

# Spring
- Brings sunlight and the blossoming of flowers and berries.

| Spring comes after winter, her relief from coming out of prison is like coming from the drab winter, to the *blossoming* spring.                                  | It shows how much she hated the prison, and how much it affected her. |
| This is a parallel metaphor for Agnes's time in prison, linked from the above Mean; "Like a punch in the dark", her imprisonment came like a *punch in the dark*. |                                                                       |

- The landscape in Hannah Kent's *Burial Rites* is more than just a setting. To what extent do you degree?:
The landscape that Kent has build throughout Burial Rites, is a cold icy landscape, where plants struggle to grow.
