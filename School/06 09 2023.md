# Petal practice
## Prompt
*How have significant symbols been used in Lion to convey the struggles that Saroo overcame to find his way home?*

## Response: PETAL
### Point
The movie Lion enhances its already comprehensive and emotional **real** prompt by using physical symbols to represent events or things that Saroo, the focus of the movie, is feeling.
### Evidence
When Saroo was lost in India, and was walking on a train track, and a woman asked, “Where are you going?” And he replied, “Looking for my family.” despite him not knowing the direction or how far away his home was.
### Explaination
This scene shows train tracks being the symbol for *the way home*, he got lost on the train, so the only way back would be to follow the train tracks. Later in his life, when he was looking for his home town on <a link="earth.google.com">google earth</a>, he followed the tracks, and found it.
### Link
This symbol links to Saroo's overall **determination**, the only way he knows to get home is the train tracks, and he just keeps on following it.
