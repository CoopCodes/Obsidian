# What was successful about the experiment
It was not necessary for this experiment to be aesthetic, in fact, I preferred it not to look good, as it would highlight how if we try to improve ourselves without God, it doesn't go well, and we need God to help. So, this experiment was successful, as it didn't look too good, but not too bad; this will aid in explaining the finished product and it's meaning, and emphasize the need for God to Scape humanity.
