# Differential Calculus
## Maximum and minimum problems
To solve maximum/minimum problems follow these steps:
1. Define the dependent and independent variables.
2. Express the quantity (dependent variable) to be maximised or minimized as a function in terms of a single independent variable. Determine the domain of this function with respect to the context.
Explain point 2, in simple terms.

In simple terms, point 2 is about expressing the quantity we want to maximize or minimize as a mathematical function. This function will have one independent variable, which represents the input or the variable we can control. The function will output the dependent variable, which represents the quantity we want to optimize.

For example, let's say we want to find the maximum area of a rectangle. In this case, the dependent variable is the area of the rectangle, and the independent variables are the length and width of the rectangle. We can express the area as a function of the length and width, such as A = length * width.

Once we have this function, we need to determine the domain of the function. The domain represents the possible values for the independent variable that make sense in the given context. For example, in the case of the rectangle, the length and width cannot be negative or zero, so the domain would be all positive real numbers.

By following these steps, we can set up the problem and apply differential calculus techniques to find the maximum or minimum value of the quantity we are interested in.

How to find velocty given force, mass, and time?

To find velocity given force, mass, and time, you can use Newton's second law of motion. Newton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.

The formula for Newton's second law is:

F = m * a

Where:
F is the force acting on the object,
m is the mass of the object, and
a is the acceleration of the object.

Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, we can rearrange the formula to solve for acceleration:

a = F / m

Once you have the acceleration, you can find the change in velocity by multiplying the acceleration by the time:

Δv = a * t

Where:
Δv is the change in velocity,
a is the acceleration, and
t is the time.

If you want to find the final velocity, you can add the change in velocity to the initial velocity:

v = v0 + Δv

Where:
v is the final velocity,
v0 is the initial velocity, and
Δv is the change in velocity.

By using these formulas, you can find the velocity given the force, mass, and time.
