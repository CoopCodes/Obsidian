Bent double, like ==old beggars under sacks==,  
**Simali** - They're limping
Knock-kneed, ==coughing like hags==, we cursed through sludge,  
**Metaphor**
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,  

And towards our distant rest began to trudge.  

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,  

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;  

==Drunk with fatigue==; deaf even to the hoots  
**Hyperbole, Idion** - Visualises that the soldiers are disoriented, tired.
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.  

  

Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling  

Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,  

But someone still was yelling out and stumbling  

And flound’ring like a ==man in fire or lime==.—  
**Metaphor**
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,  

As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.  

  

In all my dreams before my helpless sight,  

He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.  

  

If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace  

Behind the wagon that we flung him in,  

And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,  

His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;  

If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood  

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,  

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud  

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—  

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest  

To children ardent for some desperate glory,  

The old Lie: _Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori._
