- Mark the tasks that you must do (and show why).
	- If someone is more skilled.
- Work out a pattern that gives everyone in the section a chance to learn and complete a range. E.g.:
	- Planning - List of things to do
	- Installing - List of things to do
	- Documentation - List of things to do
	- If there are 5 people, you allocate one task from each section to one person, could be different for how things work.

## Action Plan
When writing an action plan you should consider:
- What is the task at hand?
- What are the major steps?
- What order should these steps take?
- Which people should be involved?
- What materials and resources will you need?
- What are the deadlines for the job?
- What major risks or hazards might be involved?
