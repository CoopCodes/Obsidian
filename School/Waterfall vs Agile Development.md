# Waterfall
- A sequential design process
	- Each phase is started, then completed before moving onto the next one.
- Once a step is completed, and you start on the next one, you cannot go back and change it. Therefore, if the original plan is flawed, it will heavily affect the development stage.

# Agile
- Develops software incrementally 
	- Dev's start off with a very simple design, and then begin to work on small modules.
