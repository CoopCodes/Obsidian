**ECT** = Eternal Conscious Torment
**Infernalism** = Eternal Hellfire
**Eonian** = Concordant version transliterates the Greek word "Aionion", this is translated as "Eternal" in most translations, but is inaccurate, and will be correctly translated later as *"of the world to come"*, this will be explained in detail later in the paper. So, when reading "Eonian", insert *"of the world to come"*.
**El** = Elohim/God
**All** = All

# Introduction
In this paper, I will outline part of my systematic theology, focusing mainly on the doctrine of Universalism, and free will. My beliefs are rooted in scripture, specifically the original Greek, and I will mostly be using the [**Concordant Literal Translation (CLV)**](https://www.concordant.org/) for scripture (occasionally others, like the **[JMNT](https://studybible.info/version/JMNT)** that show the full semantic length of the Greek), and sometimes an interlinear one.
I am a <span style="color:#ffc000">Post-Millennialist</span> <span style="color:#92d050">Libertarian</span> <span style="color:#ff4d4d">Purgatorial</span> <span style="color:#00b0f0">Universalist</span>:
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">I believe that all will eventually be saved, and <u>reconciled</u> to God</span> ([Col 1:20](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%201:20)).
- <span style="color:#ff4d4d">I believe there is a "Hell" (If you insist on calling it that), which is the Lake of Fire or Gehanna, however, is temporary, and purifying, remedial punishment </span>([Rev 21:24](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2021:24))<span style="color:#ff4d4d"> causing inner destruction, coming from the divine, fiery presence of the Lord </span>([2 Thess 1:9](https://studybible.info/Rotherham/2%20Thessalonians%201:9)).
- <span style="color:#ffc000">I believe that Jesus's Second coming has not occurred (However, there is scripture opposing this, though I have not explored it extensively), and that the dead are dead, and will rise on that day.</span>
- <span style="color:#92d050">I believe in Free Will, as it is necessary for love to exist, however love is able to override free will, as it would be not be perfect Love </span>([1 Cor 13](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2013)).
The aim of these combinations of doctrines/beliefs is to minimize and even abolish contradictions in scripture (E.g. [Lem 3:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations%203%3A31-33&version=NIV) & [Matt 25:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A46&version=NIV)), and to remove philosophical contradictions in God's character with specific scriptures and doctrines ([1 John 4:18](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20John%204:8) with Calvinistic ECT and ECT in general).

# Prayer, and plead to be open
Before we begin, I would encourage you to pray. Pray to remove your own biases, and to just let the truth be revealed. Pray that the Holy Spirit guide you as you read, Pray to Jesus that he may be revealed, Pray to God that his will may be done. After all, this is God we're debating about. God bless you as you read through this.

The things talked about in this paper is extremely different too what is commonly herd at church, so I ask you, please keep your mind open too new ideas.

# My Chosen Translations
The main translation I will be using is the Concordant Translation is an amazing translation, without any bias, and is translated directly from Greek into English; Where many of the popular translations such as the ESV are translated from Greek, to Latin, to Old English, to modern English.

![[Pasted image 20240823185339.png|200]]
[Aion Part 3 | Matthew 25:46 Commentary (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM-3DYy5pfY&list=PLxf38ffwGka3lgpto_sqbOsTuEKWJauwK&index=10)

These translations are also riddled with translators bias towards ETC, and is extremely visible in Revelation 20:10 for example:
*10 and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented **day and night forever and ever.***
	[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020%3A10&version=ESV)

*And the Adversary who is deceiving them was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the wild beast and where the false prophet are also. And they shall be tormented day and night for **the eons of the eons.***
	[CLV (Concordant Literal Translation)](https://studybible.info/CLV/rev%2020:10)

For the eons of the eons, not forever and ever, this is extremely clear in the Greek, even biased interlinear translations can't deny this translation: [Revelation 20:10](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/20-10.htm).
Additionally, they blatantly mistranslation different tenses of words, as seen in John 3:16, an Annihilationists favorite proof text:

*For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever **believes** in him should not **perish** but have eternal life.*
	[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203%3A16&version=ESV)

But in the Concordant, and if you looked at the interlinear it would be:

*For thus God loves the world, so that He gives His only-begotten Son, that everyone **who is believing** in Him should not be **perishing**, but may **be having** life eonian.*
	[CLV](https://studybible.info/CLV/john%203:16)

Thus, we can have life eonian (life of the world to come) NOW if we believe, and would be free from perishing, or being lost.
All the verbs in this verse are present tense, not future tense unlike the ESV (And many more like the NIV). If they translated it like the CLV does, it would help Internalist deny Annihilationists. This verse just shows the incompetency to translate properly, into the proper tenses; But don't get me wrong, these translations have done a lot of good spreading the Gospel.
Now you may be thinking, the CLV has a bias towards Universalism, to which I would reluctantly respond with Philippians 2:10-11, a Universalists favorite proof text:

*10 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.*
	[ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%202%3A10-11&version=ESV)

Sounds quite universalist right?

*that in the name of Jesus every knee **should be bowing**, celestial and terrestrial and subterranean, 11 and every tongue **should be acclaiming** that Jesus Christ is Lord, for the glory of God, the Father.*
	[CLV](https://studybible.info/CLV/phil%202:10-11)

These words are in the present, and active tense, and is similar to the 10 commandments, saying that all *should* be bowing, currently, but not all will (interpreting from a non-universalist perspective). This verse demonstrates the unbiasedness of the CLV. This verse can still be interpreted in a Universalist perspective, but it lessens the effect of the verse. However, fear not! There are still verses such as [Isaiah 45:23](https://studybible.info/CLV/isaiah%2045:23) and [Isaiah 66:23](https://studybible.info/CLV/Isaiah%2066:23), to reinforce Universal Salvation; 
So the reason I am using the Concordant Literal Translation, is because other translations distort the original meaning of the text, the CLV gives me confidence that I am most likely reading what the writer intended to be meant. The goal of the CLV was to accurately translate from Greek to English, but they also desired to have 1 English word for each Greek word, so a lot of the language can be confusing as they use uncommon words; So, I will also be using the [**JMNT**](https://studybible.info/version/JMNT) (Jonathan Mitchell New Testament) occasionally, which shows the full semantic range of the Greek, here's a quick example:

***Love continuously covers all mankind; it is habitually loyal to all humanity; it constantly has an expectation for all mankind; it is continuously remaining under and giving support to all people.** (or, since “all” can also be neuter: It progressively puts a protecting roof over all things; it is habitually trusting in, and believing for, all things; it is continually hoping in or for all things; it keeps on patiently enduring all things.)*
	 [1 Corinthians 13:7](https://studybible.info/JMNT/1%20Corinthians%2013:7)


# Universalism - The Outer Core of my Theology
The Inner Core of my theology is of course Jesus Christ, the foundation, the Savior of the World. But the outer core, is Universalism, the salvation of all ([Titus 2:11](https://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/titus/2-11.html)), which Jesus Christ achieved on the cross.
To properly portray this doctrine, I will first layout a [[#Thesis]], explaing exactly what I believe, and brief reasoning, and scriptural evidence as to why; then [[#Philosophical Arguments]], and then the [[#Scriptural Arguments]], and then [[#Refuting non-Universalist Proof-texts]] and, maybe even turning them into Universalist proof texts *(Mat. 25:46)*, and finally providing a [[#Concordant Defense]] to the arguments provided in all previous sections.

## Thesis
 

	

## Philosophical Arguments
Laying several philosophical arguments for Universalism, so that scripture can be interpreted properly.

### Determining a True (or Truest) Christian Doctrine
1. In order for a Christian Doctrine to be **true**, it must satisfy and be consistent with all of God's Characteristics.
2. The **truest** doctrine out of a set of doctrines MUST be the one that brings the **MOST glory to God**, as God wills that he be glorified. The glory of God is revealed whenever any of his characteristics are displayed, for example, when God's love displayed through a person, that glorifies God; To apply this example to a doctrine would be to say: As God is Love, the doctrine that displays his love THE MOST, is therefore the one that glorifies him the most. The same could be said about his omnipotence, omniscience, etc. **Therefore, the doctrine that displays his Love (or any other characteristic) the most out of a set of related doctrines is therefore the one that Glorifies God the most, and is therefore the truest doctrine out of that set.**
		*Worthy art Thou, O Lord, our Lord and God, To get glory and honor and power; For Thou dost create all, And because of Thy will they were, and are created.*
			[Revelation 4:11](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%204:11)
		*The heavens are recounting the glory of Elohim, And the atmosphere is telling the work of His hands.*
			[Psalm 19:1](https://studybible.info/CLV/Psalm%2019:1)
		*Seeing that out of Him and through Him and for Him is all: to Him be the glory for the eons! Amen!*
			[Romans 11:36](https://studybible.info/CLV/romans%2011:36)
		*Every one who is named by my name, and whom **I have made for my glory**, who has been formed and designed by me.*
			[Isaiah 43:7](https://studybible.info/bbe/Isaiah%2043:7)
4. The **truest** doctrine out of a set of related doctrines is the one that causes the believer in it to **love others, and the Lord** the most. This could be summarized in the following: **The truest doctrine in a set of related doctrines is the one that makes the believer in it, to be *more and more like Christ.***
5. The **truest** doctrine in a set of doctrines is the one that accomplishes his will to the highest extent.
6. Due to God wanting all to be saved ([1 Timothy 2:3-4](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Timothy%202:3-4)), and even saying that he will reconcile all things to himself ([Colossians 1:20](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%201:20-21), and much more); And as the doctrine that accomplishes God's Will THE MOST, it can thus be said: the **truest** doctrine in a set of related doctrines is the one that:
	1. **Saves the most people**.
	2. If you don't like that, then: **Makes the most people want to come to Jesus**.

	[Psalms 113:4-6](https://studybible.info/CLV/Psalm%20113:4-6)

*Whither could I go from Your spirit, And whither could I run away from Your presence? 8 If I should climb to the heavens, **You are there**, And should I make my berth in the unseen, behold, **You are there**. 9 Should I wear the wings of dawn, Should I tabernacle in the hindmost sea, 10 Even there Your hand would guide me, And Your right hand, it would hold me.*

#### God's Will shall be done
Definition: Everything he wills, or desires, wants or wishes, shall be accomplished (due to his [[#God is All Powerful/Omnipotent.|omnipotence]]).

This characteristic is highly debated; but is not necessary for my arguments to work.

*El is not a man that He should lie. Nor a son of humanity that He should feel regret. **Does He say it and then not do it? Or speak and then not carry it out?***
	[Numbers 23:19](https://studybible.info/CLV/Numbers%2023:19)

*Remember the first things from the eon, for I am the El, and there is no further Elohim, and the limit is as Me." 10 Telling from the beginning, the hereafter, and from aforetime, what has not yet been done. Saying, All My counsel shall be confirmed, and **all My desire will I do**.'" 11 Calling from the sunrise, a bird of prey, from a land far off, the man of My counsel. Indeed, **I speak! Indeed, I will bring it about! I formed. Indeed, I will do it.***
	[Isaiah 46:9-11](https://studybible.info/CLV/Isaiah%2046:9-11)

***The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me**; your steadfast love, O Lord, endures forever. Do not forsake the work of your hands.*
	[Psalm 138:8](https://biblehub.com/esv/psalms/138.htm)




### The Solution to Calvinism vs Arminianism
#### Calvinism
**This is the belief that God, before creation, set people apart to be his *elect*, using his sovereignty to predestine them for glory and salvation. However, there is a catch, the *un-elect* have also been set aside, and predestined to damnation, tortured for all eternity or annihilated.**
They do not believe in Free Will, but predestination, and they believe that God has set out a plan for everyone, and they don't have a choice to follow it. They're belief can be summarized into the acronym TULIP:
1. **Total Depravity**: This doctrine asserts that as a result of the fall of Adam, every part of human nature is corrupted by sin, making people incapable of coming to God on their own.
2. **Unconditional Election**: According to this belief, God has chosen certain individuals for salvation based on His will alone, not on any foreseen merit or action by humans. Key scriptural references include.
3. **Limited Atonement**: This point holds that Jesus Christ's atonement is limited to those whom God has elected for salvation. Supporting scriptures include.
4. **Irresistible Grace**: This doctrine teaches that those whom God has elected will inevitably come to faith because God's grace to save them cannot be resisted. 
5. **Perseverance of the Saints**: This belief asserts that those whom God has elected and drawn to Himself will persevere in faith until the end. They are eternally secure in their salvation.

*Not you choose Me, **but I choose you**, and I appoint you, that you may be going away and be bringing forth much fruit, and your fruit may be remaining, that anything whichsoever you should be requesting the Father in My name, He will be giving it to you.*
	[John 15:16](https://studybible.info/CLV/John%2015:16)

*That, whom He **foreknew**, He **designates beforehand**, also, to be conformed to the image of His Son, for Him to be Firstborn among many brethren. 30 Now whom He designates beforehand, these He calls also, and whom He calls, these He justifies also; now whom He justifies, these He glorifies also.*
	[Romans 8:29-30](https://studybible.info/CLV/Romans%208:29-30)

*According as **He chooses us in Him before the disruption of the world**, we to be holy and flawless in His sight, 5 in love designating us beforehand for the place of a son for Him through Christ Jesus; in accord with the delight of His will.*
	[Ephesians 1:4-5](https://studybible.info/CLV/Ephesians%201:4-5)

*for God did not appoint us to indignation, but to the procuring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,*
	[1 Thessalonians 5:9](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Thessalonians%205:9)

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#ff4d4d">John Calvin:</span>
<span style="color:#ff4d4d">We say, then, that Scripture clearly proves this much, that God by his eternal and immutable counsel determined once for all those whom it was his pleasure one day to admit to salvation, and those whom, on the other hand, *it was his pleasure to doom to destruction.*
</span>	[The Institute, John Calvin](https://www.biblestudytools.com/history/calvin-institutes-christianity/book3/chapter-21.html)

Unfortunately, there is considerable scriptural evidence for Calvinism, and the pre-purposing of the elect. 
But fear not, this scriptural evidence for Calvinism actually causes several scriptural contradictions, and highlights the necessity of Universalism:
- They posit that God *"Loves all in some ways, but some in all ways."* The thought of a God **purposing** not just 1 person, but **billions** of people to an eternal Hell, to show his sovereignty, and to bring him pleasure. This evil doctrine completely denies 2 of God's characteristics.
	- [[#God is Love.|God Is Love]] - Calvinism denies this, despite [1 John 4](https://studybible.info/search/CLV/God%20is%20Love), and many other verses. I don't care what someone may say, a God who purposes people to be damned is NOT a God of love. 
	- [[#God is Unchanging.|God is unchanging]] - In [Jeremiah 19](https://studybible.info/CLV/Jeremiah%2019) the Israelites have turned to worship a false god, Baal, and they sacrifice children in The Valley of Hinnom, and God is disgusted that children are being burned alive in fire to pleasure Ball. And in [Jeremiah 19:5](https://studybible.info/CLV/Jeremiah%2019:5), God says: *"That thought never entered my mind"*; According to Infernalism, not only did the thought enter his mind, HE DID implement it, not only a place where children would burn and die, but where they would burn for ALL ETERNITY, NEVER ENDING. This denies God's [[#God is Unchanging.|Unchangeability]].
- This denying of God's **Love** and **Unchangeability** this immediately <u>disproves</u> it as a true doctrine, as agreed in [[#Determining a True (or Truest) Christian Doctrine]]. 
- Calvinists deny that God desires all to be saved, as if he did, he would have died for all. 
	- *For this is ideal and welcome in the sight of our Savior, God, 4 **Who wills that all mankind** be saved and come into a realization of the truth.*
			[1 Timothy 2:3-4](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Timothy%202:3-4)
	- *The Lord is not tardy as to the promise, as some are deeming tardiness, but is patient because of you, not intending **any to perish**, but all to make room for repentance.*
			[2 Peter 3:9](https://studybible.info/CLV/2%20Peter%203:9)
- They believe that Christ died <u>only</u> for the elect, but deny the abundant scriptures stating otherwise:
	- *Who is giving Himself a correspondent Ransom for all.*
			[1 Timothy 2:6](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Timothy%202:6)
	- *On the morrow he is observing Jesus coming toward him, and is saying, "Lo! The Lamb of God Which is taking away the sin of the world!"*
			[John 1:29](https://studybible.info/CLV/John%201:29)
	- *And He is the propitiatory shelter concerned with our sins, yet not concerned with ours only, but concerned with the whole world also.*
			[1 John 2:2](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20John%202:2)
Arminianists would agree with me on the above, however what they cannot do, is also endorse the Calvinist proof texts as stated previously ([John 15:16](https://studybible.info/CLV/John%2015:16), [Rom 8:29-30](https://studybible.info/CLV/Romans%208:29-30), etc.), however Universalists can. This will be discussed further in [[#The Solution]].
To summarize, Calvinism has strong scriptural backing, but cannot explain away very many scriptural contradictions. The doctrine in a whole puts Gods sovereignty over all the other characteristics of God, and even outright overriding some, such as His [[#God is Love.|Love]] for all mankind.

#### Arminianism
**This is the belief that Christ died for *all*, but not all will accept it due to free will, and you become the 'elect' by believing in this lifetime.** This belief can be summarized into the following points:
1. **Partial Depravity**: Humans are depraved due to sin but are still capable of seeking God with the assistance of grace, which enables them to respond to the Holy Spirit.
2. **Conditional Election**: Due to his [[#God is All-Knowing.|foreknowledge]], God knows, during creation, who would choose him and who would not; However, due to free-will He is unable to stop some from being damned, despite His desire too.
3. **Unlimited Atonement**: Christ's atonement is sufficient for all humanity, but it is effective only for those who believe. This means Jesus died for everyone, not just for the elect.
4. **Resistible Grace**: God's grace can be resisted by individuals. People can choose to reject God's call to salvation.
5. **Conditional Salvation**: Believers can fall from grace if they choose to reject the influence of the Holy Spirit in their lives. This contrasts with the Calvinist belief in the perseverance of the saints.

*For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.*
	[John 3:16 (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV) 

*For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who is beholding the Son and believing in Him may have life eonian, and I shall be raising him in the last day.*
	[John 6:40](https://studybible.info/CLV/John%206:40)

*I am the living Bread which descends out of heaven. **If** anyone should be eating of this Bread, he shall be living for the eon. Now the Bread also, which I shall be giving for the sake of the life of the world, is My flesh.*
	[John 6:51](https://studybible.info/CLV/John%206:51)

*And from all from which you could not be justified in the law of Moses, in this One everyone **who is believing** is being justified.*
	[Acts 13:39](https://studybible.info/CLV/Acts%2013:39)

*For not ashamed am I of the evangel, for it is God's power for **salvation to everyone who is believing** - to the Jew first, and to the Greek as well. 17 For in it God's righteousness is being revealed, out of faith for faith, according as it is written: "Now the just one by faith shall be living.*
	[Romans 1:16-17](https://studybible.info/CLV/Romans%201:16-17)

*Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen expatriates of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, the province of Asia, and Bithynia, 2 according to the foreknowledge of God, the Father, in holiness of spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: May grace and peace be multiplied to you!*
	[1 Peter 1:1-2](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Peter%201:1-2)

Arminianism does have a strong argument towards the Calvinist proof texts, saying that the elect are the ones *foreknown* by God to willingly choose him. However, it puts into question God's character just as Calvinism does:
**If Arminianism is true, then God foreknew the *eternal* damnation of some, yet still created them**.
To portray the absurdity of this, I will describe a situation with a Father, and you tell me if the Father is a loving father:

___

There is a Father, and he has a son named Jacob. Jacob has depression, and possible mentally disabled; and wants to **kill himself**. Jacob runs into his Fathers room, and says straight-faced, "I am going to kill myself". The Father did nothing, as he did not want to violate his sons free will, and The son, Jacob ran out and immediately jumped off their 5-story apartment building; Into a pit of fire where Jacob was burned to death, and then revived, and then burned to death again, and again forever and ever. The Father knew this pit was there, and that he would jump into it, and he actually designed it for Jacob, as he knew his son would not choose it.

___

The Father in this situation is not a [[#God is Love.|Loving]] Father, and would be blamed for his eternal destiny, or death (for Annihilationists).
There is another problem however, this Arminianist God also *desires all to be saved* ([1 Timothy 2:3-4](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Timothy%202:3-4)), but because of free will, he can't, he does not have the power too. 
Therefore he does not have the power to find a way to respect a persons free will, and still reconcile him.

*Now, looking at them, Jesus said to them, "With men this is impossible, yet **with God all is possible.****"*
	[Matthew 19:26](https://studybible.info/CLV/Matthew%2019:26,%20Psalm%20147:5)

Arminianist claim that an All Loving God knowingly creates humans destined for Hell or Annihilation. This situation can be defined as: **Ethical responsibility in creation and design, where the creator or designer bears moral accountability for foreseeable negative outcomes affecting those under their influence or within their domain**. With this definition, we can find some situations that fit this definitions in the Bible:
Arminianist claim that an All Loving God knowingly creates humans destined for Hell or Annihilation. This situation can be defined as: **Ethical responsibility in creation and design, where the creator or designer bears moral accountability for foreseeable negative outcomes affecting those under their influence or within their domain**. With this definition, we can find some situations that fit this definitions in the Bible:

*When you build a new house, then you must make a parapet for your housetop so that you do not **bring blood-guilt on your house** in case someone **falling from it might fall to death.***
	[Deuteronomy 22:8](https://studybible.info/CLV/Deut%2022:8)

*When a man opens a cistern, or when a man digs a cistern, yet **does not cover it**, and a bull or a donkey falls therein, 34 the possessor of the cistern, **he shall repay**; he shall restore silver to its possessor, and the dead beast shall become his.*
	[Exodus 21:33-34](https://studybible.info/CLV/Exodus%2021:33-34)

Then it is clear that the Arminianist God is still morally responsible ("Blood-guilt" as per Deut 22:8) for the damnation of some, even if they chose it themselves, and even if it is not eternal damnation.

***Telling from the beginning**, the hereafter, and from aforetime, what has not yet been done. Saying, **All My counsel shall be confirmed, and all My desire will I do**.*
	 [Isaiah 46:10](https://studybible.info/CLV/Isaiah%2046:10)

And bringing in God's foreknowledge and omnipotence into it, emphasizes this moral responsibility all the more.

**Therefore, the Arminianism Doctrine not only denies 1 of God's characteristics, but *4*:**
1. **The [[#God is Love.|Love]] of God** - The Father could have saved him, but didn't, and denies that [Love is forgoing all](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2013:7)) (1 Cor 13:7), therefore, this God is not All-loving; However, they do not deny this as much as Calvinists.
2. **The [[#God is All Powerful/Omnipotent.|Omnipotence of God]]** - The Father wanted to save the child, but couldn't.
3. **The [[#God's Will shall be done|All-Powerful Will of God]]** - The Fathers will was not done.
4. **The [[#God is Unchanging.|Unchangeability of God]]** - Just as mentioned in [[#Calvinism]]: In [Jeremiah 19](https://studybible.info/CLV/Jeremiah%2019) the Israelites have turned to worship a false god, Baal, and they sacrifice children in The Valley of Hinnom, and God is disgusted that children are being burned alive in fire to pleasure Ball. And in [Jeremiah 19:5](https://studybible.info/CLV/Jeremiah%2019:5), God says: *"That thought never entered my mind"*; According to Infernalism, not only did the thought enter his mind, HE DID implement it, not only a place where children would burn and die, but where they would burn for ALL ETERNITY, NEVER ENDING. This denies God's [[#God is Unchanging.|Unchangeability]], this also applies, yet not as bad, to Annihilationists, who think that the wicked will be burned and therefore annihilated.
This doctrine violates 4 (thankfully to a lesser extent unlike [[#Calvinism]]) of the essential characters of God, and therefore, is a false Christian doctrine, as agreed in [[#Determining a True (or Truest) Christian Doctrine]].
<span style="font-size:.8rem; font-style:italic;">(There will be more on the Open-Theist (Free will) argument later in this paper for my SDA friends reading.)</span>

#### The Solution
The solution to this argument is a doctrine of salvation that does not diminish ANY of God's characteristics, and upholds all as necessary. And this doctrine is **Universalism**; Which is the only [soteriological](https://www.britannica.com/topic/soteriology) doctrine that can affirm ALL of God's characteristics, without any stretch:
- God is [[#God is Love.|Love]] - He loves all creation, and would never let any go beyond redemption, he [**forgoes all, believes all, expects all, and endures all**]([1 Corinthians 13:7 is forgoing all, is believing all, is expecting all, is enduring all." (studybible.info)](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2013:7)) (1 Cor. 13:7).
- God is [[#God is All Powerful/Omnipotent.|All Powerful]] - Not only does God love all, and desire all to be saved ([1 Timothy 2:3-4](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Timothy%202:3-4)), but his desire for all to saved WILL happen, as all things are possible with God. ([Matthew 19:26](https://studybible.info/CLV/Matthew%2019:26,%20Psalm%20147:5)).
- God is [[#God is All-Knowing.|All Knowing]] - He knows everyone's destiny, which is to be reconciled with him ([Colossians 1:20 CLV](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%201:20-21)), and he creates them knowing this.
- God is [[#God is Omnipresent.|Everywhere]] - *If I should climb to the heavens, You are there, And should I make my berth in the unseen* (Sheol, wrongly translated as Hell)*, behold, You are there.* [Psalms 139](https://studybible.info/CLV/Psalms%20139)
- God is [[#God is Unchanging.|Unchanging]] - God will not burn his children in fire for death or eternity, in fact it never entered his mind ([Jeremiah 19:5](https://studybible.info/CLV/Jeremiah%2019:5)), whatever punishments he inflicts are for remedial purposes.
- God's [[#God's Will shall be done|Will shall be done]] - He will get what he wills ([Isaiah 46:9-11](https://studybible.info/CLV/Isaiah%2046:9-11)), all shall be saved ([1 Timothy 2:3-4](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Timothy%202:3-4)); Which affirms his [[#God is All Powerful/Omnipotent.|Omnipotence]].
Universalism can also affirm with all the proof texts in Calvinism AND Arminianism, without having to stretch meanings:
- **The elect** exist, and God has elected them before the disruption of the world ([Ephesians 1:4-5](https://studybible.info/CLV/Ephesians%201:4-5)). However, they are to "*Be a light to the nations, to become My salvation unto the ends of the earth* (I.e. bringing salvation to the ends of the Earth)*"* ([Isaiah 49:6](https://studybible.info/CLV/Isaiah%2049:6)). They are lifted up to save the rest of the world, just as Israel was lifted up to be a light to the nations. Check out [(58) Vessels of Wrath or Mercy? (Election Part 2) - The Jesus Trip - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRnuVm0f5g) for more info.
- **You will have eonian life if you believe**, there is a difference between eonian (Commonly translated as 'eternal') life and being saved, this will be discussed further in the paper.

##### The Most Loving Doctrine
[[#Determining a True (or Truest) Christian Doctrine]] states that the **truest** doctrine out of a set of related doctrines is the one that causes the believer to **love others and the Lord THE MOST**. Universal Salvation is that doctrine, Here are the practical benefits of believing in universalism:
- **Everyone** is your eternal sibling in Christ, they have been created through Christ, for Christ ([Col. 1:16](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%201:16)), and **will** return to Christ; All the wrongdoings that happen now **will** be resolved, I can **forgive all** ([Matt. 18:21-22, 70 * 7](https://studybible.info/CLV/Matthew%2018:21-22)), I know they will all realize the truth, and I will as well, and we will all be reconciled to each other. Just as Jesus said on the cross *"Father, **forgive** them, for they know not what they do"* ([Luke 23:34](https://studybible.info/CLV/luke%2023:34)). All will be well, we shall be **All in All** ([1 Cor. 15:28](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2015:28)).
- **Christ is in everyone** ([Eph. 4:6](https://studybible.info/CLV/Ephesians%204:6)), everywhere I see I see Christ, he is in everyone and through everyone, with each person I talk to I can see Christ in them, in their smile, in their heart. But, as Paul said we are like **Fragile clay pots**, containing this great treasure ([2 Cor. 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204%3A7&version=NLT)), and for some people there are barely any cracks to see the treasure, but for some, there is very little pot anymore. This layer is sin, and Christ chips away at this layer of sin. And all people have this treasure of time, it's just a matter of time when it will be fully revealed.
- **Therefore, I love all.** I love Christ, therefore I love all,  for he is in all and through all. No matter what someone does I still love them, but loving them doesn't mean I give into them, I rejoice when they see the truth ([1 Cor. 13:6](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2013:6)). Because I love all, I do not want any to be perishing because of their unbelief, therefor I evangelize, so that Christ can work on them as he works on me.
- **Therefore, I love the Lord all the more**. *"We are loving God, for He first loves us"* ([1 John 4:19](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20John%204:19)). How much more do I love the Lord my God because I know he will save all, he loves everyone through and through, I can put my trust and faith in him as I know he will make all things right.


##### The Most Glorifying Doctrine
[[#Determining a True (or Truest) Christian Doctrine]] states that that **1.** The **truest** doctrine in a set of related doctrines MUST be the one that brings the MOST Glory to God; and **2.** As God is Love, the doctrine that glorifies him the most is the one that displays his love the most. 
So, which doctrine out of the 3 brings God the most glory?:
- Is it Calvinism? Where God is glorified by some in Eternal Life, and some who are Eternally Damned, held in a state of perpetual burning. Calvinists would state that both bring him Glory; But by no means does it display his Love, which is [[#God is Love.|one of God's essential characteristics]], and thus does not Glorify him. Let me ask, which person is more respected or  glorified: 
	- There are two Fathers, **Father A** and **Father B**, they both have 5 children. Both sets of children have been caught inside their inflamed house.
		- **Father A** decides to save three of his children from a burning building as he preferred them, leaving the other two, whom he did not like, to behind to perish in the flames. He claims this demonstrates both his mercy (for those he saved) and his justice (for those he left).
		- **Father B** risks his own life to save all five of his children from the burning building, refusing to leave anyone behind despite the danger to himself.
	- This visualization obviously shows the absurdity of Reformed Theology (Calvinism), as Father B is clearly more glorified than Father A, in fact Father A would be deemed guilty for their death.
- Or is it Arminianism? Where only a portion of his creation glorify him, and to God's dismay the rest are in Hell or Annihilated, because he couldn't seem to find a way to respect their free will, and get them too choose him. This is akin to a Father running into his fire-engulfed house, and asking each child *"do you want me to save you?"*, and due to the choking on smoke, they couldn't respond, so he didn't save them, as it was a "Violation" of their free will. So therefore, in the end, at the consummation of the Eons ([Heb. 9:26](https://studybible.info/CLV/Hebrews%209:26)), not everyone will be glorifying him out of their free will, and God **will not be All in All** ([1 Cor. 15:28](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2015:28)). Where he did not do the most loving thing to do, that was to save them **all**. Thus this is not the doctrine which brings the most Glory to God.
- The doctrine that brings the most glory to God is in fact **Universalism**, where **ALL** things, [whether things in the heavens and that on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or sovereignties, or authorities](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%201:16) (Col. 1:16), ALL are **openly** and **gladly** confessing ([Phil. 2:11](https://studybible.info/CLV/Philippians%202:11)) that Jesus Christ is Lord, to his UPMOST glory. FULLY displaying God's INFINITE love, which is [long-suffering, and all-enduring](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2013:7) (1 Cor. 13:7). Where all is made for his glory ([Isaiah 43:7](https://studybible.info/bbe/Isaiah%2043:7)).
	*By Myself I swear. From My mouth fares forth righteousness, and My word shall not be recalled. For to Me shall bow every knee, and every tongue shall acclaim to Elohim.*
		[Isaiah 45:23](https://studybible.info/CLV/isaiah%2045:23)

So I ask again, which soteriological doctrine brings God the most glory, and which displays all of his characteristics the most?

### Issues with Non-Universalist Doctrines

#### Binaric Morality/Sins
Infernalism and Annihilationism have hold a binary judgment, that is, that in on judgment day, either people will go to Heaven if they are sinless, or hell if they are not. This idea posits that all people deserve the exact same punishment, a man who had sex before marriage deserves the same punishment as a mass-murder; **The millions of victims of Hitler deserve the same punishment as Hitler himself**; which is absolutely absurd. 
This philosophical states that: ***Non-Universalists state that either a person goes to Heaven or Hell; thus, all moral inequities (offenses) are the same, gluttony is the same as murder, and both deserve equal (eternal) punishment.*** 
Jesus outright said some people would be worse off on judgment day than others:

*And whosoever should not be receiving you, nor yet be hearing your words, coming outside of that house or city or village, shake off the dust from your feet." 15 Verily, I am saying to you, **More tolerable** will it be for the land of Sodom and the land of Gomorrah in the day of judging than for that city.*
	[Matthew 10:14-15](https://studybible.info/CLV/Matthew%2010:14-15)

And according to non-universalists, this does not happen, everyone gets the same punishment. This aligns with **Purgatorial Universalism**: where on the day, God will reveal his raw self to all, and the fiery Passion ("[ὀργή](https://biblehub.com/greek/3709.htm)", Translated as wrath but can mean Passion) of his Love shall burn away all that is not of that Love; **and it lasts for however long it takes for the sinner to no longer be a sinner** (*and under no circumstances may anything contaminating, or one who is making an abomination and a lie be entering into it*, [Rev. 21:27](https://studybible.info/CLV/rev%2021:27)), however long it takes for Saul to become Paul.
#### Visualizing the Abhorrence of Hell (Sensitive Content)
Jessica is in her car on her way home after a party, she's had 2 or 3 drinks and didn't think much of it, its 12AM with barely any cars after all, she won't get pulled over. As she reaches the intersection at Fletcher Street, she forgot look at the lights, and before she knew it, too her right there was a speeding red P's car flying towards her, ***BANG***. Her eyes close and she feels her side crush like a can under foot; She opens her eyes again, and all she can see is flames, she hears screaming from all around her, slowly she began to feel an extremely sharp pain on her skin, *fire* she thought, she tried to run but she couldn't move, she was paralyzed. The burning got worse, she could see the her white flesh boil and turn to black and melt off her person, she screamed in agony as she slowly began to see her bones from under the red bubbling muscles. Her nerve endings began to destroy, and the sharp pain turned to a deep, dull ache; *Finally*, she thought, *sweet death*, and as she saw the last bit of flesh drip off her, like a camel spitting, her flesh regenerated, watching, layer by layer her skin grow back. A sense of terrorful dread come over her as her last skin cell regenerated, she screeched in absolute agony and terror more than before, *HELP ME, PLEASE*. Her body was engulfed in conflagration once again, and that sharp pain came back; She stopped breathing and began to choke, and as her she saw her bones, the skin came back. 
300 billion years later, Jessica is still there to this day, howling out a cry of help, but to no avail. She has only tasted a single drop of the torment that she will endure, in fact her torment will NEVER end. At this point all that Jessica remembers is pain, her life on Earth is now only 0.000001% of her existence, she doesn't even remember what she did wrong anymore. She doesn't even know her own name, all she knows is fire, and the screams of those around her. Every now and then, she silently whispers under her breath: *But I didn't know.*

#### If you truly believed in Infernalism
If you TRULY believed in ETERNAL CONSCIOUS TORMENT even remotely similar to the above, might not be a physical fire, but mental fire. Then why:
- ***Why* are you not spending every last minute of your day preaching the "good news" to every single person you see, as if you aren't they're missing out on a chance of salvation; and because of that missed chance, they will be damned to an ETERNAL HELL, where they will be *burned forever and ever*.** The very fact that if you believe in this demonic doctrine and are not preaching makes YOU a second hand murderer and torturer. If you know that a doorway leads to a fire, where if anyone walks through it they will be perish for all eternity, and you don't tell Little Johnny who's walking towards it, that that is there, then you are guilty for his perpetual death. The very fact that you are reading this right now and not preaching to people makes you immoral, the fact that you are not preaching right now makes you a murderer. I believe there are very little who actually, consciously believe that there is an eternal hell of fire; 
- ***Why* even have children, if you believe that there IS EVEN A 1% CHANCE of your child going to an eternal hell of fire, then why have them**. Having children is immoral and evil, if Infernalism is true, a true church of Christians would condemn anyone having children. It's like making a game show, and you bring your friends too it, but you know that there's a large change that they could lose, and die, yet you still bring them, hoping that they would all win. **And not only do they die, they are dying forever and ever**, you bringing them there is evil even if they die; If Infernalism is true, then being a parent is equivalent, no, in fact logically it's **infinitely worse**, than the organizers of the Squid Games. 

It is so saddening to see such a horrible evil doctrine has weaved it's way into Christianity, children grow up fearing hell so much they have nightmares about it, and cry and have inner torment for people they think are in there. It's such a shame that most if not all Christians are brought up in this, and if you believe in Infernalism right now, it's ok, you probably haven't looked into it much, and believe it by inheritance; And if you have looked into it, you were probably reading the KJV or NIV, which does teach ECT, and is riddled with contradictions and translator bias. 

#### Not telling us the age of accountability

#### Unjustness of an un-free choice, and the randomness it necessitates


#### The Heaven Problem




#### Why have children?

### God, the Greatest Conceivable being



## Scriptural Arguments
### Removing the Augustinian Lens
It is no doubt that St. Augustine did a lot of good in Christianity, but he also popularized the doctrine of ECT, and this act of his has persuading the whole of Christianity from 500AD onwards to endorse the doctrine of Infernalism. 
I argue that the philosophical arguments for Universalism are irrefutable, and if you believe you have refuted it, read **[That All Shall Be Saved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_All_Shall_Be_Saved) by David Bentley Hart, 2019**, which is currently an un-refuted philosophical argument for Universalism; Which covers different, very complex arguments, those of which I could not properly explain in this paper, nor even comprehend.
Due to this bedrock of philosophy, we must interpret scripture in a way that satisfies these arguments, and most importantly, the [[#The Characteristics of God|Essential Characteristics of God]]. 

### Defining αἰώνιος (aiónios/aiónion)
There have been many different different definitions for this very ambiguous word. The most common by far are ***eternal, everlasting, or forever***, used in all the popular translations such as the NIV, ESV, KJV and much more. When this is the translation, Infernalism is apparent in the scriptures. But many Christian scholars have doubted this translation, as it causes contradicts not only throughout God's Characteristics, but through different verses, such as *"For no-one is cast off by the Lord **forever**"* ([Lem. 3:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations%203%3A31&version=NIV)), and *"They will be punished with **everlasting** destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might"* ([2 Thess 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thess%201%3A9&version=NIV) NIV). Both talk about being cast off by the Lord, and therefore directly contradict each other. 

*αἰώνιος* is directly derived from the word *αἰών* (noun), which literally means [*age*](https://biblehub.com/greek/165.htm) , or *eon* (as the CLV translates it). And *αἰώνιος* is the adjective of *αἰών*.
- **Adjective:** a word that modifies or describes a noun or pronoun. It gives more information about the qualities, characteristics, or attributes of a person, place, thing, or idea. For example: *Nature* is a noun, and *Natural* is it's adjective.

#### Pertaining to an Age, age-long
So, if aiónion is the adjective of aión, then it must mean *age-like*, or *"of an age"*, *pertaining to an age*, or simply put *"agey"*. Most lexicons would agree with this:
- *Strong's Concordance*: agelong
- *HELPS Word-studies*: "age-like" ("like-an-age"), i.e. an "age-characteristic" (the quality describing a particular age); (figuratively) the unique quality (reality)
- *NAS*: agelong

And this definition is apparent in some places in the Septuagint, the Hebrew Bible translated into Koine Greek by religious leaders in Jesus' times. 

*To the roots of the mountains I sank down;  
    the earth beneath barred me in **forever**.* (aiónios)  
*But you, Lord my God,  
    brought my life up from the pit.*
	[Jonah 2:6 (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah%202%3A6&version=NIV)

Taking a look at the Septuagint Greek:

*κατεβην εις γην ης οι μοχλοι αυτης κατοχοι **αιωνιοι*** (aiónios) *και αναβητω φθορα ζωης μου κυριε ο θεος μου*
	[Jonah 2:6 (LXX_WH)](https://studybible.info/LXX_WH/Jonah%202:6)

Was Jonah in the fish forever? No he was in there for an *age*, or what felt like *age-long*.

*But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, I will not go till the child has been taken from the breast, and then I will take him with me and put him before the Lord, where he may be **forever**.* (aiónios)
	[1 Samuel 1:22 (BBE)](https://studybible.info/BBE/1%20Samuel%201:22)

Samuel served in the temple for his lifetime, not forever, he served there *age-long*, or *pertaining to an age*, **which was his lifetime**.

*Then his master is to take him to the gods of the house, and at the door, or at its framework, he is to make a hole in his ear with a sharp-pointed instrument; and he will be his servant **forever.*** (aiónios)
	[Exodus 21:6 (BBE)](https://studybible.info/BBE/Exodus%2021:6)

Will he be his servant forever? Or just *age-long*, specifically the age of the servants life, **pertaining to the servants age/lifetime**.

**Here are some non-biblical sources**:

*“condemned to perpetual (aionios) imprisonment”* 
	[(The War of the Jews, Book VI)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Jews/Book_VI#Chapter_9) - Josephus (37-100 A.D.)

Josephus was talking about John the Tyrant, and his imprisonment, which was by no means eternal. It was just for his lifetime, thus **pertaining to an age**, which was his lifetime.

**Therefore**, we can **generally** define αἰώνιος as *pertaining to an age, the length of which, depends on the noun it is describing*. I would say ***persisting*** or ***lasting*** is a good way to describe this usage of the word:
*"condemned to **persisting** imprisonment"*


#### The Nicene Creed's definition
However, I believe in the New Testament, when in the context of Judaism, it can mean something else. 
And it's definition inscribed in the last sentence of the most recited creed in Orthodox and Catholic Christianity; That is the [**Nicene Creed**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20significant,the%20trinity%20as%20a%20whole.). 
The fathers were aware of the confusion from translating the **Apostles Creed**, where Latin speakers translated αἰώνιος into *"aeternum"*, where the 1st definition of that word is [*"Of an age"*](https://latinlexicon.org/word_study_tool.php), but with the 2nd definition being *"eternal"*. This confusion was in the last sentence of the creed, stating: 

*"and the life everlasting. Amen."*
	[Apostles' Creed](https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/apostles-creed)

In Greek this is: *"ζωὴν **αἰώνιον**. Ἀμήν."*

So when the Nicene Creed was released, the council unpacked this word to deter this confusion, here is the last sentence of the Nicene Creed:

| Greek                                | English                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| καὶ ζωὴν τοῦ μέλλοντος αἰῶνος. ἀμήν. | and the life **of the world to come**. Amen |
*([earlychurchtexts.com](https://earlychurchtexts.com/public/nicene_creed.htm))*

I believe that in context of Judaism, this word does not mean *pertaining to an age*, but *pertaining to **The Age***, the Messianic Age. Notice how this definition does not change much from the general definition, just changing an *"an"* to a *"the"*. This change in definition in the 1st century is an effect which can be describe as: *"Semantic shift through proper noun association"*, or in simpler terms:

*"When a common word takes on a new, specific meaning because of its growing connection to a well-known concept, such as a brand, or product"*

An example of this effect taken on nowadays can be found:
- The word *"Cloud"*, it can mean a *cloud*. Or in technology contexts, it can mean *The Cloud*, remote servers used for storing and accessing data over the internet.
- The word *"Web"*, it can be a *web*. Or in tech, mean *The Web*.

This definition is also shown in the bible, in the parallel passages of The Unforgivable Sin:
*yet whoever should be blaspheming against the holy spirit is having no pardon for the eon, but is liable to the **eonian*** (αἰώνιον) *penalty for the sin-"*
	[Mark 3:28-29](https://studybible.info/CLV/Mark%203:29)

Parallel in Matthew:
*And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither **in the world to come.***
	[Matthew 12:32](https://studybible.info/AKJV/Matthew%2012:32) (ESV)

Matthew would have had a copy of Marks Gospel at the time of writing it, as Matthews gospel was the 2nd written *([When were the gospels written](https://stpaulcenter.com/when-were-the-gospels-written/), 2024)*, and yet still chose to translate it as this, because in this context they mean the same thing! 
There will be a more in-depth section on how the Unforgivable Sin (Better translated as Unpardonable) fits in with Universalism in:[[#The Unpardonable Sin]].

This definition is also evident in 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9

*And to you who are being afflicted, ease, with us, at the **unveiling of the Lord Jesus** from heaven with His powerful messengers, 8 in flaming fire, dealing out vengeance to those who are not acquainted with God and those who are not obeying the evangel of our Lord Jesus Christ" 9 who shall incur the **justice of eonian destruction<span>*</span> from the face of the Lord**, and from the glory of His strength*
	[2 Thess. 1:7-9](https://studybible.info/CLV/2%20Thessalonians%201:7-9)
<p style="font-size:.7em;">* : The CLV translates this word "ὄλεθρος" as "extermination", but I have changed it to "destruction", as it is a more literal translation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/3639.htm">biblehub</a>).</p>
In v.7 it is speaking about at the <u>unveiling</u> of Jesus, directly at his second coming, which is still in this [wicked eon](https://studybible.info/CLV/Galatians%201:4), or the transition between; Not in the world/age **to come**. This <u>worldly</u> destruction of the wicked is described in Revelation:

*And out of His mouth a sharp blade is issuing, that with it He should be **smiting the nations**. And He will be shepherding them with an iron club. And He is treading the wine trough of the fury of the indignation of God, the Almighty.*
	[Revelation 19:15](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2019:15) (The chapter describing Jesus's 2nd coming)

Many people use this to prove Infernalism, but the Lake of Fire is only **after** the 1000 year reign of Jesus' and the saints, after the resurrection of the dead, NOT at Jesus's unveiling. So, therefore eonian in this context **cannot be referring to eternal punishment.**

- It could mean *Of the World to come*, and Paul is using Eonian to specify when this destruction is occurring, here's the verse with this translation:
	- *And to you who are being afflicted, ease, with us, at the **unveiling of the Lord Jesus** from heaven with His powerful messengers, 8 in flaming fire, dealing out vengeance to those who are not acquainted with God and those who are not obeying the evangel of our Lord Jesus Christ" 9 who shall incur the justice of destruction **in the world to come** from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of His strength*
- Or it could mean *Of the World to come*, but in a different sense: *Having characteristics of the World to come*, such as divine power, Godliness, etc.
	- *9 who shall incur the justice of destruction **OF the world to come** from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of His strength*
	- Or to further emphasize this meaning: *9 who shall incur the justice of destruction **of The Age** from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his strength* 


#### Of the Eons
Whilst the general definition of the word is *pertaining to an age*, as it is an adjective, derived from *"aion"*, it could also mean *pertaining to **the ages***, or *the eons*, this definition is also evident in scripture:

*Who saves us and calls us with a holy calling, not in accord with our acts, but in accord with His own purpose and the grace which is given to us in Christ Jesus **before times eonian***
	[2 Timothy 1:9](https://studybible.info/CLV/2%20Timothy%201:9)

*Now to Him Who is able to establish you in accord with my evangel, and the heralding of Christ Jesus in accord with the revelation of a secret hushed **in times eonian***
	[Romans 16:25](https://studybible.info/CLV/Romans%2016:25)

*in expectation of life **eonian**, which God, Who does not lie, promises before **times eonian***
	[Titus 1:2](https://studybible.info/CLV/Titus%201:2)

Now, this meaning is specifically invoked by the noun *"times"*, so it does not mean this in all contexts.


#### Eonian Conclusion
To conclude, the word αἰώνιος is a highly flexible word, which no English word can properly convey, and has several valid meanings in specific contexts; But it's primary definition is:

*Pertaining to an age*, *Having characteristics of an age which is described by the attached noun*, *Age-like*. For example:
- *Age-like life*.
- *Persisting life*.
- *Life having the characteristics of an age (For example, long)*.
**Or**
- *Age-like imprisonment*.
- *Persisting imprisonment*.
- *Lasting imprisonment*.
- *Imprisonment holding the characteristics of an age (Such as feeling like a long time)*

This meaning does not force the sense of forever, but can when attached to specific nouns. 

However, in the broad context of Judaism, specifically the New Testament, it had a slightly different meaning:
Rather than *Pertaining to an age*.
Is was *Pertaining to **The Age***.
For example:
- *Life **of The Age***.
- *Life having characteristics of **The Age***.
- *Punishment **of The Age***.
- *Life **of The World to Come***

**This will be the primary definition used to interpret αἰώνιος throughout the New Testament.**

Finally it could mean *pertaining to the **eons***.

Notice in the last 2 definitions, they only vary slightly from the primary definition, and thus it is plausible that all 3 definitions were valid in their specific contexts by native Greek readers of the New Testament.


### Eonian Life vs Salvation
Eonian life (Life of the world to come), is different than being saved.

#### Eonian Life (Life of the world to come)
##### 1st definition
Life of the World to come is given to those who **believe in this lifetime** ([John 3:16](https://studybible.info/CLV/john%203:16), [Luke 18:18](https://studybible.info/CLV/Luke%2018:18), etc.), and they will be resurrected first, and reign with Christ for 1000 years, while the non-believers are still dead:

*Happy and holy is he who is **having part in the former resurrection**! Over these the second death has no jurisdiction, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and **they will be reigning with Him the thousand years**.*
	[Revelation 20:6](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2020:6)

*and those who do good shall go out into a **resurrection of life**, yet those who commit bad things, into a **resurrection of judging.**"*
	[John 5:29](https://studybible.info/CLV/John%205:29)

Additionally, people with Eonian life will not be thrown into the Lake of Fire (Refiners Crucible), as they do not need to be refined.

However, we can also experience Eonian life **now**:

*For thus God loves the world, so that He gives His only-begotten Son, that everyone **who is believing** in Him should not be perishing, but may be **having life eonian**.*
	[John 3:16 (CLV)](https://studybible.info/CLV/John%203:16)

All the words here are *present* tense, happening now. And if we are saved in this age, we can have eonian life NOW, and 

### The Lake of Fire
*And the devil that deceived them was cast into the **lake of fire** and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be **tormented** day and night **for ever and ever***
	[Revelation 20:10 (ERV)](https://studybible.info/ERV/Revelation%2020:10)

*13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was **judged according to what they had done**. 14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. **The lake of fire** is the second death. 15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into **the lake of fire**.*
	[Revelation 20:13-15 (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020%3A13-15&version=NIV)

##### For ever and Ever
On the surface, this verse seems to completely deny the doctrine of Universalism, stating that the Lake of Fire lasts *forever and ever*; However, simply looking at the Concordant Translation, reveals the true meaning:

*And the Adversary who is deceiving them was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the wild beast and where the false prophet are also. And they shall be tormented day and night for the **eons of the eons**.*
	[Revelation 20:10 (CLV)](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2020:10)

**The eons of the eons**, not forever and ever, this translation of forever and ever honestly is a horrid translation, completely removing 2 definite articles (the) and blatantly changing the meaning of *aionas*, which just means *ages*. Even the ESV interlinear can't deny this:

![[Pasted image 20240829223106.png]]
https://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/20-10.htm

If this did mean *forever and ever*, there would be a direct contradiction between Revelation 11:15, and 1 Corinthians 15:25:

*The kingdom of the world has become
the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah,
and he will reign **for ever and ever**.”*
	[Revelations 11:15 (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011%3A15&version=NIV)

*For he must reign **until** he has put all his enemies under his feet.*
	[1 Corinthians 15:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1_corinthians%2015%3A25&version=NIV)

In the Concordant:

*"The kingdom of this world became our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall be reigning **for the eons of the eons**! Amen!"*
	[Revelation 11:15 (CLV)](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2011:15)

So therefore, he reigns **until** he has put all enemies under his feet (reconciled all to himself), and this process happens in the Eons of the Eons where the first *Eons*, is a subset of the second *Eons*, where Christ reigns (***"The Eons of the Eons"***); Then once he has subject all to himself, the consummation of the eons will occur ([Heb. 9:26](https://studybible.info/CLV/Hebrews%209:26)), where God is All in All ([1 Cor. 15:28](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2015:28)). 
Additionally, the only time "The eons of the eons" is being applied, is to the Devil and his angels, or the beast. This is not being applied to any humans, so their sentence in the Lake of Fire will not last for all the Eons of the Eons like the Devil.

[REFINED IN THE LAKE OF FIRE II | THE EVIDENCE PART 2 (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds9VScbsW2Q&list=PLxf38ffwGka2UciayXpkXLfcnPsCTqYRh&index=5)

##### Lake (λίμνη, limné)
The Greek word for Lake in passages like Rev. 20:10, is limné, which is defined as:
	[lake, marsh, basin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BC%CE%BD%CE%B7)
	or:
	[also, artificial pool or basin](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=li/mnh)
The main reason the translations translate this word to *Lake*, is because this is what Luke used to describe the Sea of Galilee (Gennesaret) ([Luke 5:1](https://studybible.info/CLV/Luke%205:1)); However, John (the author of Revelation) used the word *"θάλασσα, Thalassa"*, instead of limné (John 6:1), it is defined as:
	[a particular sea or lake](https://biblehub.com/greek/2281.htm)
And you would agree that, the understanding of John is more important than Luke's. So, the world Limne can be used to describe an artificial pool or basin, here are some things that can be defined as a limne:
![[Pasted image 20240829230853.png|300]]

![[Pasted image 20240829230826.png|300]]

![[Pasted image 20240829230913.png|300]]

![[Pasted image 20240829230932.png|300]]

![[Pasted image 20240829231023.png|300]]

And finally, this is a Limne:
![[Pasted image 20240829231107.png|400]]

Specifically, a Limne of fire and sulphur, like described in Revelation. Koine Greek does not have an exact word for crucible, unlike Hebrew, so John had to spell it out, saying *"The limné burning with fire and sulphur"* (Rev. 21:8). He is referring to the Hebrew Bible's Crucible metaphor, and many more verses talking about God's refining properties:

*The smelter for silver and the **crucible** for gold, Yet Yahweh is testing hearts.*
	[Proverbs 17:3](https://studybible.info/CLV/Proverbs%2017:3)

*And I will bring the third into the fire. And I will **refine** them as silver is refined. And I will **test them as gold is tested**. It shall call in My name, and I will answer it. I will say, My people is it. And it will say, Yahweh is my Elohim.*
	[Zechariah 13:9](https://studybible.info/CLV/Zechariah%2013:9)

*And he shall sit as a **refiner and cleanser of silver and gold**. And he shall cleanse the sons of Levi, and cupel them as gold and as silver. And they shall come to be for Yahweh, bringing close the approach present in righteousness.*
	[Malachi 3:3](https://studybible.info/CLV/malachi%203:3)

*Remove away the dross from silver, And a vessel shall come forth for the refiner;" 5 Remove away the wicked one from before the king, And his throne shall be established in righteousness.*
	[Proverbs 25:4-5](https://studybible.info/CLV/Proverbs%2025:4-5)

*The house of Israel has been to Me for dross, All of them are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, In the midst of a furnace--dross has silver been, 19 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of your all becoming dross, Therefore, lo, I am gathering you unto the midst of Jerusalem, 20 A gathering of silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, **Unto the midst of a furnace--to blow on it fire, to melt it**, So do I gather in Mine anger and in My fury, And I have let rest, and have melted you." 21 And I have heaped you up, And blown on you in the fire of My wrath, And you have been melted in its midst." 22 As the melting of silver in the midst of a furnace, So are you melted in its midst, And you have known that I, Yahweh, I have poured out My fury upon you.'"*
	[Ezekiel 22:18-22](https://studybible.info/CLV/ezekiel%2022:18-22)

*And I will turn My hand on you, **and refine, so as to purify you from your dross. And the rebellious will I destroy, and take away all your tin alloy.***
	[Isaiah 1:25](https://studybible.info/CLV/Isaiah%201:25)


Thus, I will be referring to the Lake of Fire, as *The Refiners Crucible* from now on.

##### Tormented (βασανίζω, basanizó)
This idea of refinement, and testing of the heart is further reinforced by the word *βασανίζω*:

*and they shall be **tormented** day and night for ever and ever
	[Revelation 20:10 (ERV)](https://studybible.info/ERV/Revelation%2020:10)

This word is translated as *Tormented* in most translation, however looking at various lexicons (not all) will define it as:
**Strong's Concordance**: 
1. *I examine, as by torture.*
**Thayer's Greek Lexicon**: 
1. *properly, to **test** (metals) by the touchstone.*
2. *to question by applying torture.*
**Wiktionary Etymology**: 
1. *From [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "w:Ancient Greek") [βασανίζω](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B6%CF%89#Ancient_Greek) (basanízō, “**to examine, to investigate, put to the test**”), from [βάσανος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B2%CE%AC%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "βάσανος") (básanos, “**touchstone**”) +‎ [-ίζω](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%CE%AF%CE%B6%CF%89#Ancient_Greek "-ίζω") (-ízō, “verbal suffix”), literally **“to test with touchstone”**. The modern sense of "torture" developed from the association of investigations and inquisitions of prisoners with physical tortures.*

It is clear that βασανίζω is a type of testing, but through torture, *interrogation*, tested by fire; To test the purity of the heart.

*And I will bring the third into the fire. And I will **refine** them as silver is refined. And I will **test them as gold is tested**.
	[Zechariah 13:9](https://studybible.info/CLV/Zechariah%2013:9)

So, in the Refiners Crucible, not only shall the inhabitants shall refined by fire, but be interrogated, tested by fire: *are they're hearts pure enough?* As you know, nothing unclean can enter the kingdom ([Rev. 21:27](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2021:27))


##### Sulphur/Brimstone (θεῖον, theion)
*burning with fire and sulphur*
	[Revelation 21:8 (excerpt)](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2021:8)

Many people think the use of Sulphur/Brimstone in the Lake of Fire increases the pain and suffering of those inside; And I would agree, but it also refines them faster, and more effectively:

*A more speedy method of removing iron, copper, lead and base metals from bullion is to **add sulphur to the molten metals***
	[www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/sulphur-refining-gold#:~:text=A%20more%20speedy%20method%20of,a%20temperature%20below%20300%20deg.)

*The ancient Greeks used sulfur as a disinfectant*
	[U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 02-298 (usgs.gov)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-298/#:~:text=The%20ancient%20Greeks%20used%20sulfur,sulfur%20was%20an%20essential%20component.)

Googling *"Purifying metals with sulphur"* will show you many webpages explaining how adding sulfur to molten metals removes any unneeded iron, copper, lead, and possibly even brass, and tin, iron, and lead ([Ezekiel 22:19](https://studybible.info/CLV/ezekiel%2022:18-22))! John specifically uses this word to further push the Crucible word picture. 
Some translations translation theion as *brimstone*, and this too has purifying properties, looking at the biblehub lexicon shows this:

[**Thayer's Greek Lexicon**](https://biblehub.com/greek/2303.htm): *apparently the neuter of the adjective θεῖος equivalent to divine incense, because burning brimstone was regarded as having power to **purify**, and to **ward off contagion***

This word *"theion"* is derived from the word *"theios"*, which can be  defined as:

**Strong's Concordance**: *divine, the Deity*
**HELPS Word-Studies**: *theíos (an adjective, derived from 2316 /theós, "God") – divine, manifesting the characteristics of God's nature.*
**NAS Exhaustive Concordance**: *divine*
**Thayer's Greek Lexicon**: *divine, deity*
**Strong's Exhaustive Concordance**: *godlike, divine, godhead.*

Thus, it is clear that sulphur and brimstone are Purifying substances, even coming from the divine presence, lining up with ([2 Thess 1:9](https://studybible.info/Rotherham/2%20Thessalonians%201:9)).


##### The Second Death
Annihilationists love to use this as a proof text, and on the surface it can be:

*Yet the timid, and unbelievers, and the abominable, and murderers, and paramours, and enchanters, and idolaters, and all the false-their part is in the lake burning with fire and sulphur, which is **the second death.***
	[Revelation 21:8](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2021:8)

However, taking this literally causes 2 main contradictions:
1. The universal resurrection into the **imperishable, immortal**:
	- [1 Cor. 15:22](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2015:22) shows the universal resurrection (most would agree).
		- *For even as, in Adam, all are dying, thus also, in Christ, shall all be vivified.* 
	- However, [v.42](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%2015:42) says *the dead*, which is everyone, will be roused in incorruption
		- *Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is roused in **incorruption*** ([Commonly translated as immortal](https://biblehub.com/greek/861.htm))
	- Therefore, the all will be resurrected, and be resurrected into **immortality**, thus cannot die after the resurrection.
2. The Kings of the Earth.
	- In [Revelation 21:24](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2021:24), the Kings of the Earth bring their glory into the kingdom; But weren't they just tempted by the beast? And thrown into the Lake of Fire?
		- *And the nations shall be walking by means of its light, and the **kings of the earth are carrying their glory into it**.*
	- In the [[#Lake of Fire Conclusion]], this verse will be examined in more detail.

###### So what is the Second Death?
Throughout the New Testament, there are several instances (especially in Pauline writings) talking about our *old self* being crucified with Christ **dying** with him, so that we can be *set free from sin*.

*knowing this, that our old humanity **was crucified together with Him**, that the **body of Sin may be nullified**, for us by no means to be still slaving for Sin, 7 **for one who dies has been justified from Sin**. 8 Now if we died together with Christ, we believe that we **shall be living together with Him also**, 9 having perceived that Christ, being roused from among the dead, is no longer dying. Death is lording it over Him no longer, 10 for in that He died, He died to Sin once for all time, yet in that He is living, He is living to God." 11 **Thus you also, be reckoning yourselves to be dead, indeed, to Sin, yet living to God in Christ Jesus, our Lord."***
	[Romans 6:6-11](https://studybible.info/CLV/Romans%206:6-11)

*3 **for you died**, and your life is hid together **with Christ** in God." 4 Whenever Christ, our Life, should be manifested, then you also shall be manifested **together with Him in glory*** (Kings of the Earth bringing their glory?)*." 5 **Deaden**, then, your members that are on the earth: **prostitution, uncleanness, passion, evil desire and greed, which is idolatry**, 6 because of which the indignation of God is coming on the sons of stubbornness 7 among whom you also once walked, when you lived in these things." 8 Yet now you also be putting away all these: anger, fury, malice, calumny, obscenity out of your mouth." 9 Do no lie to one another, **stripping off the old humanity together with its practices***
	[Colossians 3:3-9](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%203:1-11)

*Verily, verily, I am saying to you, If a kernel of grain, falling into the earth, should not be dying, it is remaining alone, yet if it should be **dying**, it is **bringing forth much fruit.***
	[John 12:24](https://studybible.info/CLV/John%2012:24)

*With Christ **have I been crucified**, yet I am living; **no longer I**, but living in me is Christ. Now that which I am now living in flesh, I am living in faith that is of the Son of God, Who loves me, and gives Himself up for me.*
	[Galatians 2:20](https://studybible.info/CLV/Galatians%202:20)

*to put off from you, as regards your former behavior, the **old self** which is corrupted in accord with its seductive desires, 23 yet to be rejuvenated in the spirit of your mind, 24 and to put on the **new self** which, in accord with God, is being created in righteousness and benignity of the truth.*
	[Ephesians 4:22-24](https://studybible.info/CLV/Ephesians%204:22-24)

*So that, if anyone is in Christ, there is a **new creation**: the primitive **passed** by. Lo! there has come **new**!*
	[2 Corinthians 5:17](https://studybible.info/CLV/2%20Corinthians%205:17)

*Being **entombed together with Him in baptism**, in Whom you were roused together also through faith in the operation of God,*
	[Colossians 2:12](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%202:12)

This is why the second death has no jurisdiction on those in the former resurrection.

*Happy and holy is he who is having part in the former resurrection! **Over these the second death has no jurisdiction**, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will be reigning with Him the thousand years.*
	[Revelation 20:6](https://studybible.info/CLV/Rev%2020:6)

For we have already been baptized! Died! Died to sin! And resurrected with Christ and we are to live with him *NOW* and him in us, *It is not me living, but Christ who lives in me* ([Galatians 2:20](https://studybible.info/CLV/Galatians%202:20)). Those in the Refiners Crucible will be baptized, but **with fire**.

*For I, indeed, am baptizing you in water for repentance, yet He Who is coming after me is stronger than I, Whose sandals I am not competent to bear. He will be baptizing you in holy spirit and **fire.***
	[Matthew 3:11](https://studybible.info/CLV/Matthew%203:11)


##### Lake of Fire Conclusion
So therefore, all the *unbelievers, abominable, murderers, paramours, enchanters, idolators, and the **false*** ([Rev. 21:8](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/21-8.htm)) shall be in the *Refiners Crucible* burning with *fire and sulphur*, which is the *second death*, where they're hearts, their purity, shall be tested by the touchstone, examined by fire. They shall endure *destruction coming from the Face of the Lord* ([2 Thess 1:9](https://studybible.info/Rotherham/2%20Thessalonians%201:9)), yet they shall be saved, but as through the fire ([1 Cor. 3:15](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%203:15)). 

This beautiful message of Hope, and Refinement for the wicked is fully cemented by John in the latter parts of Revelation:

*with whom the **kings of the earth** commit prostitution, and those dwelling on the earth are made drunk with the wine of her prostitution."*
	[Revelation 17:2](https://studybible.info/CLV/rev%2017:2)

*Yet the timid, and unbelievers, and the abominable, and murderers, and paramours, and enchanters, and idolaters, and all the false-their part is in the lake burning with fire and sulphur, which is the second death."*
	[Revelation 21:8](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2021:8)

Thus, the Kings of the Earth were thrown into the Lake of Fire.

*And the **nations shall be walking by means of its light**, and the **kings of the earth** are carrying their glory **into** it." 25 And its portals should **under no circumstances be locked by day**; for there shall be no night there. 26 And they shall be carrying the glory and the honor of the nations **into it**, 27 and under no **circumstances may anything contaminating**, or one who is making an abomination and a lie be entering into it, except those written in the **Lambkin's scroll of life**.*

But they shall be entering the kingdom! Through the portals! And they not be *contaminated*! They will not be an *abomination* nor a *lie*, they have died to their old self, and risen with Christ; after all, how could they *bring their glory into it* if they cannot enter it? And I ask, who's name is written in the scroll of life?:
- ***Hoshea? or Joshua?
- ***Solomon? or Jedidiah?
- ***Saul? or Paul?**
- ***Abram? or Abraham?
- ***Sarai? or Sarah?
- ***Jacob? or Israel?
- ***Simon? or Peter?***

The old Kings of the Earth's name's shall not be written in the scroll, but they shall have new names! New identities, new men! To symbolize their death to sin, and birth in Christ, they have been made new! 

*"Lo! For I am making all things **new**"*
	[Rev. 21:5](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2021:5)

*And the spirit and the bride are saying, **'Come!' and let him who is hearing say, 'Come!'** And let **him who is thirsting come**. Let him who will, take the water of life gratuitously.*
	[Revelation 22:17](https://studybible.info/CLV/Revelation%2022:17)

This beautiful picture of refinement for the sinner that John painted, is also backed up explicitly by Paul in 1 Corinthians, and is my go-to bible verse to explain the basis of Purgatorial Universalism:

*11 For other foundation can **no one** lay beside that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
12 Now if anyone is building on this foundation gold and silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw, 
13 each one's work will become apparent, **for the day*** (Judgement Day) *will make it evident, **for it is being revealed by fire**. And the fire, it will be **testing*** (Possibly testing by the touchstone, basanizó) *each one's work - what kind it is. 
14 If anyone's work will be remaining which he builds on it, he will get wages." 
15 If anyone's **work shall be burned up**, he will forfeit it, yet he shall be **saved**, yet thus, **as through fire.***
	[1 Corinthians 3:11-15](https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%203:11-15)

He shall be saved, **but as through fire**. As we know, Jesus is in all ([Eph. 4:6](https://studybible.info/CLV/Ephesians%204:6)), and thus **no-one** can lay a foundation other than Jesus Christ. And Judgement day will reveal it, when we come into the fiery presence of the Lord, and if the work is burned away, they will receive a loss, but if it withstands (So it will be with those who believe in this eon), they will receive a reward. **This passage encapsulates what Purgatorial Universalism is**.

Additionally, it can be inferred that the Refiners Crucible is God, or a way that God's fiery presence can affect a person, a perceived characteristic of God. This is due to two parallel verses in Isaiah and Revelation:

*And **death and the unseen were cast into the lake of fire**. This is the second death-the lake of fire.*
	[Revelation 20:14](https://studybible.info/CLV/rev%2020:14)

***He swallows up death permanently**. And my Lord Yahweh will wipe every tear off of all faces, and the reproach of His people will He take away off all the earth, for the mouth of Yahweh speaks."*
	[Isaiah 25:8](https://studybible.info/CLV/Isaiah%2025:8)

Death is thrown into the Lake of Fire, according to Revelation, yet **God** swallows up death, therefore it can be logically inferred that the Lake of Fire IS God; *The Refiners Crucible IS God*, and John is using it as a metaphor to give light into an aspect of God:

*And he shall sit as a **refiner and cleanser of silver and gold**. And he shall cleanse the sons of Levi, and cupel them as gold and as silver. And they shall come to be for Yahweh, bringing close the approach present in righteousness.*
	[Malachi 3:3](https://studybible.info/CLV/malachi%203:3)




He who is thirsting COME yea in the Lake of Fire, burning with sulphur, whom wishes that thy would dip thy fingertip on yea mouth, for yea are in anguish in the fire, COME, let yea who is thirsty COME.

Revelation is a beautiful story showing the wrath and justice of God, and his hate of sin, but there **no** tension between this and his [[#God is Love.|Omnibenevolence]], for his wrath is again sin, not the sinner, he hates what it is doing to us, how it destroys us. So when all his children are finally fully in his hands, he will **destroy** everything in them that is not of him, and finally restore the child, finally bring back that lost sheep, that lost coin, that lost son; 
For GOD IS LOVE ([1 John 4:16](<[1 John 4:8 & 4:16a](https://studybible.info/search/CLV/God%20is%20Love)>)) and NO ONE is cast off by him forever ([Lem. 3:31)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=lamentations%203%3A31&version=NIV), and he is glad to reconcile all things to himself ([Col. 1:20 CLV](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%201:20-21)), for he sent himself on the cross to SAVE THE WORLD ([John 3:17](https://studybible.info/CLV/john%203:17)), for he loved the world that much, that he gave his only begotten son, to save the world through him, whom became flesh for our sake, to die once for ALL ([Heb. 10:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010%3A10&version=NIV)). Whom of which saved us and fixed us; Whom is all that matters, for He is over all and through all and in all ([Eph. 4:6](https://studybible.info/CLV/Ephesians%204:6)), for He holds all creation together ([Col. 1:16](https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%201:16)), for He is Love ([1 John 4:8](https://studybible.info/search/CLV/God%20is%20Love)), for He is in person sitting across from you, for He IS that Love you feel with your parents, for He IS that love you feel with your partner. For He is your smile, for He IS your laugh, for He IS your kindness, for He IS your Love, for He IS you. For He is for you ([Rom. 8:31](https://studybible.info/CLV/romans%208:31)), and nothing nor height nor depth nor death nor life can separate us from his LOVE ([Rom. 8:38-39](https://studybible.info/CLV/Romans%208:38-39)), praise be to him YAHWEH LORD OF HOSTS, ADONAI, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, NAME ABOVE EVERY OTHER NAME, THAT TO HIM EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW AND TONGUE CONFESS THAT HE IS LORD ([Phil. 2:10-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202%3A10-11&version=NIV)). PRAISE BE TO HIM. PRAISE BE TO HIM THE YAHWEH ELYON.


## Refuting non-Universalist Proof-texts

### 2 Peter 3:9
*The Lord is not tardy as to the promise, as some are deeming tardiness, but is patient because of you, not **intending** any to **perish**, but all to make room for repentance." 10 **Now the day of the Lord** will be arriving as a thief, in which the heavens shall be passing by with a booming noise, yet the elements shall be dissolved by combustion, and the earth and the works in it shall be found*
	[2 Peter 3:9-10](https://studybible.info/CLV/2%20Peter%203:9-10)

For the Arminian Annihilationist, this verse is a good proof text, but rises some issues if talking about post-mortem destruction:
- This verse is clearly referencing the events AT **the day of the Lord**, Jesus's second coming. Where Jesus [*smites the nations*](https://studybible.info/CLV/2%20Revelation%2019:15). Most would agree, however it is NOT talking about post-mortem punishment/destruction, but the extermination of the wicked at Jesus's return. 

Many universalists say, "Well if God is all-powerful, then he will make non perish, and all to come
to repentance"; And I agree, he will *eventually*. But I believe this verse is talking about the destruction that shall come upon the wicked AT his coming, and they shall indeed perish. This is why God is putting it off, as he wants the least amount of people to be disobeying is evangel, or to not be associated with him. And they will perish from the might have Jesus and his powerful messengers.

*And to you who are being afflicted, ease, with us, at the **unveiling of the Lord Jesus** from heaven with His powerful messengers, 8 in flaming fire, dealing out vengeance to those who are not acquainted with God and those who are not obeying the evangel of our Lord Jesus Christ
	[2 Thess. 1:7-8](https://studybible.info/CLV/2%20Thessalonians%201:7-9)

programmer creates a simulation, and you tell me if the programming is an all-loving person:
There is a programmer, who creates an earth simulation where he creates billions of people, real people who have free will. However, the programmer also created a star, where if people when they die are bad, they go to the surface of that star for all eternity, burning alive forever. On the other hand, he created a place designed for human happiness, for all eternity as well.
