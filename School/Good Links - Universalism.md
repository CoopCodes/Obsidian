## Isaiah 66:
[JRP's Exegetical Compilation: Isaiah 66:24 - Evangelical Universalism - The Evangelical Universalist Forum](https://forum.evangelicaluniversalist.com/t/jrps-exegetical-compilation-isaiah-66-24/5093/2)

**My soul yearns for you in the night; my spirit within me earnestly seeks you**. For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 9 In the night I search for you; in the morning I earnestly seek you. For only when you come to judge the earth will people learn what is right.

**And He will destroy on this mountain  
The surface of the covering cast over all people,  s
And the veil that is spread over all nations.  
He will swallow up death forever,  
And the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces;  
The rebuke of His people  
He will take away from all the earth;  
For the LORD has spoken.**

a. **The veil that is spread over all nations**: This is what the LORD will **destroy**. The picture is that there is a **veil that is spread over all nations** that keeps them from seeing God, loving God, and obeying God. In this glorious day, the LORD will destroy that veil.

The fire of Hell is the way someone experiences God's love, tormented; The feeling when you know you've been unfaithful to a friend, or a mate, and you have to come to terms with it. This is why it is described as abhorrence in Daniel 12:2. And why it is coming from the face of God in 2 Thess 1:9.
The fullness of death to the old man, bringing life to the new.
Love that burns sin out of you

Isaac the Syrian
If we even say that he will hand us too the fire in order for us to suffer, to torment us.

Deu 4:2  **Ye shall not add unto the word** which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

Rom 6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that **are alive from the dead**, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
Deu 12:32  What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: **thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it**.

Rom 6:4  Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  
Rom 6:5  For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of his resurrection:  
Rom 6:6  Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

zachariah 7:9

[Isaiah 50:11 See, all you who make a fire, arming yourselves with burning branches: go in the flame of your fire, and among the branches you have put a light to. This will you have from my hand, you will make your bed in sorrow. (studybible.info)](https://studybible.info/BBE/Isaiah%2050:11)****

Many people have speculated the true definition of this word:
- **Age-abiding** - Pertaining to an age, as αἰώνιος is the adjective form of αἰών (aión) which means just *an age*. 
- **Indefinite** - an amount of time without a specified ending.
- **Eonian** - Pertaining to the Eons, eons before the consummation of the eons ([Heb. 9:26](https://studybible.info/CLV/Hebrews%209:26)).

- Great or Brutal, Godly, Divine. 
	- This is plausible as Paul says "*(coming) in flaming fire, dealing out vengeance to those who are not acquainted with God and those who are not obeying the evangel of our Lord Jesus Christ" 9 who shall incur the justice of eonian destruction*".
	- The use of "**Who**" in v.9 indicates the subject is the unbelievers AT his unveiling, thus the eonian destruction is towards them, and the action is from the Face of God, and his powerful messengers (angels).
