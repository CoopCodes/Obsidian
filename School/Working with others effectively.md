Tim wants the team to discuss ways of improving sales to meet an additional key performance indicator (KPI) which he has added to the team’s yearly appraisals.

1. From the Case Study Scenario outline above, identify the overall workgroup objective and at least two (2) individual responsibilities for each team member. (You may need to conduct further research to find this information.)
2. Identify two (2) methods an individual team member could use to share data during the meeting
3. Steve received feedback from Tim that he needs to use more open-ended questions to encourage his team members to discuss topics more openly. Provide an example of an open-ended question Steve could ask his team members. Make sure the question is relevant to the main objective.
4. Danielle is showing signs that she might be experiencing some difficulty. She is usually very talkative and enjoys social gatherings but now she is a lot quieter and isolates herself. Within the context of the relevant team objective, how could Steve (her manager) support her?
5. For each team member, identify one (1) way they can contribute to the main objective of the workgroup.
6. Identify one (1) strategy that the workgroup could use to improve their performance according to the main objective.
7. English is Olu's (the Advertising and Marketing Manager’s) second language. She has diverse thinking and brings good ideas to the team, but sometimes she struggles to follow conversations.

Two members of the Superior Cars sales team, Pete and Danielle, are clearly having an issue with each other. Steve, the sales manager, suspected something might be wrong when he noticed a frosty atmosphere whenever the two were in each other’s company recently. This was confirmed in a separate event later. They are both called into Steve’s office. The following conversation is an extract from Steve’s meeting notes:

Danielle: “_He started it._”

Pete: “_Typical_.”

Danielle: “_Well, you did. You stole my customer._”

Pete: “_How can I “steal” a customer? They don’t belong to you_.”

Danielle: “_Oh come on. You knew she was a regular customer of mine_.”

Steve investigates further and identifies the customer in question. Pete had indeed made a sale to this customer around two weeks ago. He could also see that Danielle had made two sales to this customer previously


Ideally The Superior Cars company should have a policy regarding this situation. However, if not, follow the following policy:
Scenario 1:
	Sales Person 1 has made a sale to a customer previous to current. If the customer comes in again and there are multiple Sales People present, including Sales Person 1, Sales Person 1 should have priority of the customer, as they know the customer, and have context of what the customer wants.
Scenario 2:
	Sales Person 1 has made a sale to a customer previous to current. If the customer comes in again and there are multiple Sales People present, un-inclusive of Sales Person 1 (they may be on a lunch break, or not present that day), then anyone can approach the customer.
Scenario 3:
	Sales Person 1 has made a sale to a customer previous to current, and Sales Person 2 has also made a sale to the same customer previous to current and after 1st sale. If the same customer comes in again and both Sales People are present, the following steps should be taken:
	- Whoever has spent the most time with the customer AND received a sale from this time spent, has priority.
	- If time spend has not resulted in a sale, the other person who has made the sale previously has priority.
	Whilst the above steps are black & white, there are other factors that could determine which Sales Person would be best, such as time between current and previous sale, or amount of money a sale resulted in. This scenario is a grey area, and the most fit sales person to talk to the customer would be best determined within the exact context of the scenario, and all sales people should discuss what should happen.

The conflict between Pete & Danielle is best described by Scenario 1, thus Danielle has priority over Pete. Steve should explain this to both Pete and Danielle in a matter-of-fact manner, and used to resolve the conflict, not add to Danielle's argument. Steve should request of them to respect this policy to ensure further conflicts do not occur.



The conflict at Superior Cars involves two sales team members, Pete and Danielle, who are at odds with each other. Their frosty relationship is brought to the attention of their manager, Steve, who calls them into his office to address the issue. During the meeting, Danielle accuses Pete of stealing her customer, to which Pete responds by denying the accusation and questioning the ownership of customers. Steve later discovers that Pete had made a sale to a customer who had previously bought from Danielle. This situation has led to tension and a dispute over customer ownership and sales.



# Conflict 2
There has also been tension between Steve and Olu, who cannot agree on how to market the electric vehicle.
