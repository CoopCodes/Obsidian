# Task
Create a short story that draws on the perspectives, concepts, identities, times or places represented in one of the monologues you have studied this term from the play 'The 7 stages of grieving' by Wesley Enoch and Deborah mailman. Your short story should explore and convey some of the ideas, attitudes, values or beliefs that underpin the original monologue; however, you may play with the setting - time and place.

To complete this task you must:
- Choose a monologue you have studied from the play
- Make use of the ways cultural assumptions, attitudes, values and beliefs underpin your text in order to challenge or engage with perspectives from the monologue in your story.
- Decide how you would like your readers to take up positions as you represent concepts and identities in your story.
- Make language choices and sequencing decisions in order to weave a central idea through your story
- Use aesthetic features to prompt critical or emotional responses from your readers
- Adhere to the genre conventions of the short story: title, correct grammar, (especially tense) and spelling, and formatting of dialogue etc.
