# Representations and Perspective
*What the texts are saying about the **concepts, ideas, identities, places** or **time** they are exploring.*

## Representations
- How a writer presents the word to **represent** ways of thinking about or acting in the world.

## Perspective
- The way a reader/viewer is positioned by a text.
- Where the author places the reader. For example Hannah Kent gives us the view of Agnes, and changes our **perspective** to have empathy for her.

## Example
*These two are often intertwined:*

Most literary representations of war are incredibly graphic and confronting. And they often leave out the dull stuff between conflicts. To share a negative perspective of war, they need to represent it as dangerous and destructive.

Tip: Dissect the representations and perspectives in your text to figure out what it's saying about the world.


# Cultural Assumptions
- Ideas, beliefs or attitudes about things like gender, religion, sexuality, and class that are ingrained in a certain society or culture.
	- A writing in the 1700s will have different cultural assumptions than someone now.
- So research you composers cultural assumptions to understand their representations.
- **Also the cultural assumptions of the audience**
	- If they like it, depends on their cultural beliefs.
	- For example shakespears juliet
		- Juliet is portrayed as being submissive, due to his cultural assumptions, so people nowadays are less likely to connect with the writing.


# Aesthetic Features and Stylistic Devices

## Aesthetic Features
*The way a text interacts with an audience through the unique features of its mode.*
> Example: A poem and a play connect with an audience in very different ways
> 	But a poem is more reliant on the reader's imagination as they read through it
> 	
> 	A play offers an immediate and immersive performance that uses visual and sound cues

## Stylistic Devices
A composers distinct way of arranging aspects of a text, including language and form.
It distinguishes the works of different writers.
