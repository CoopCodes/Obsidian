- **<span style="color:#ff4d4d">**Good afternoon, students and teachers**</span>
-** <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#0070c0">**Introduce**
- **Explain why I should get school captain**</span>

==------------------------------==

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#ff4d4d">Good afternoon students and teachers</span>
<span style="color:#0070c0">I'm Cooper, and I'm going to explain to you why you should vote me for school captain, if i could just have *opens mouth* of your time</span>


- <span style="color:#ff4d4d">**School is great but it is lacking applicable information, 'life skills'**
	- **Taxes, changing a tire, prompting Chat GPT to do assessments, and more **</span>
- <span style="color:#0070c0">**I'm gonna bring back life skills a couple times a term**</span>

==------------------------------==

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#ff4d4d">School is a great place for learning, and socialization. But one thing it lacks in teaching are life skills. After graduating from school heaps of students just have no idea what to do with their money, how to do taxes, and heaps of other basic things.</span>
<span style="color:#0070c0">So If i were to become school captain i would bring back the class life skills, which was a class we had last year, but they removed it. It would be a couple times a term, and would teach basic things such as taxes, changing a tire, and possibly the most useful, prompting Chat GPT to do your assessments.</span>

<span style="color:#ff4d4d">- **How i miss the practical chapels, giving back to the community**
	- **Giving to mothers in need, stuff like that**</span>
- <span style="color:#0070c0">**How doing this represents the school well**</span>

==------------------------------==

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-weight:bold; color:#ff4d4d">Another thing i miss the school used to have, was the practical chapels. Where we would serve the community. One time we made **boxes** of basic hygienic items for struggling mothers, who couldn't afford it.</span>
<span style="color:#0070c0">Not only does this help other people, but it helps give our school the reputation of a group of kind, generous young people helping the community, living up to the Christian title.</span>



- <span style="color:#ff4d4d">***"The world is your oyster"*** - **Is my personal motto**</span>
- <span style="color:#0070c0">**How I know that I have so many opportunities to do good in any environment that i am in, that is why I am seizing this opportunity to be school captain, and I think "*with my determination and work ethic, i can achieve a lot of things.*"**</span>

==------------------------------==

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#ff4d4d">Despite me despising oysters, my personal motto is "The world is my oyster",</span> <span style="color:#0070c0">i know that everyone has so many opportunities. And i have this amazing opportunity to be school captain, and i think with my determination, organisation skills (my bed is made), and work ethic, i can make a difference in this school.</span>

- ***"I have been at the school for 12 years, and I love the community"***
- **Talk about how you are grateful that you have this opportunity to serve the community.
- **And will not take it for granted:**
	- Will help with many events to take **stress off of teachers**, and personally organize *Life skills*, and the practical chapel.
- ***"So how is everyone?", "That's great.", but if you aren't:***
	- ***"I want you to know that I can always help you, get the help you need, or just listen."***

==------------------------------==

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#ff4d4d">Serving this school is something i have wanted to do for the 12 years i have been here, and I'm so grateful for this opportunity.</span>
<span style="color:#0070c0">And of course, if i were to be school captain i would help organize the life skills class, and practical chapel, and a lot of other events like i have in the past, to the best of my ability.</span>
<span style="color:#92d050">Anyways, how is everyone?<br>
I can't hear you that's my bad. (It's a feature not a bug)<br>
But if you weren't good, I will always be there for you to help or just listen, no matter the outcome of the election.</span>

<span style="color:#ffc000">I just wanted to reiterate how grateful i am for this opportunity to serve this amazing community.<br> I've always been supported here, and I'm proud to represent this school.<br> And whatever the outcome of the vote is I'll support whoever gets elected.</span>

- **"But before i finish", Thank everyone, especially mum**
- ***"Thankyou for guiding me through my journey, and bringing me to where i am now."***
- Thank the audience for listening

<span style="color:#ff4d4d">Before i finish i just wanted to thank all the amazing teachers, friends who have helped me immensely through my schooling career. <br>
But most importantly I want to thank my mum for being with me my whole life and supporting me through everything.</span>

<span style="color:#92d050">And thankyou for listening!</span>

<span style="color:#ffc000">Oh and i need to thank chat gpt for writing this (Just kidding)</span>
