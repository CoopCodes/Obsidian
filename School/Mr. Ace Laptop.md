Hey Mr. Ace,   
I come with a request:  
As you know in my traineeship I am doing a lot of programming, most of which requires admin permissions. 
My home computer recently broke, thus I have been relying on my school computer to the the programming on.   

At work I am provided with a PC, however at home I cannot continue whatever I may be working on at work as I do not have permissions. 

My problem is not not having admin permissions, I have all the applications i require, it is the deep security that IT has put in the laptop, a firewall, and even when i have a programming package, for example, installed, I cannot run it as contacts specific web addresses that are not working on the school computer. I have gone to Mr. Kirkland and Mrs. Mullen previously and they could not figure out the issue during the lunch period when i did not need my computer.
  
Additionally, I am looking to build my business, and work on my programming skills, this is being prevented as well.

I could possibly get the firewall removed, I'm unsure as to how difficult this would be however. But i was thinking that perhaps I could buy the computer as if i were graduating, or like how you can buy it in year 9. And it could be classified as my computer, and I could get it reimaged and use it however I like.
