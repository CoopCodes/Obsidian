2.    What event originally inspired Enoch to write the play?  

3.    What does the writer state is the intention of the play?  

4.    How has Mailman’s attitude towards her Indigenous background changed?  

5.    What does Mailman like and dislike about acting?  

6.    Why does Mailman say that the play is not purely autobiographical?



1. Deborah Mailman met Wesley Enoch when he was her first-year voice coach while she was studying drama at Queensland University of Technology. They became good friends, connecting over both being Indigenous Australians.
2. The event that originally inspired Enoch to write the play was the death of his grandmother in 1993.
3. The stated intention of the play was to avoid Indigenous stereotypes/clichés and create something that pushed beyond that, integrating aspects of traditional storytelling with photography, soundscapes, and a stylized set.
4. Mailman was not always aware of her Indigenous background growing up, as her family did not acknowledge their Aboriginal culture at home. It was only in her senior school years that she started asking questions about it. Her acting career has helped her learn more about her own Indigenous stories and background.
5. Mailman likes the storytelling aspect of acting, but dislikes the celebrity limelight and "red carpet" aspects. She values her privacy.
6. Mailman says the play is not purely autobiographical, but rather what her co-writer Enoch has termed "faction" - a collection of experiences from people they know, not just Mailman's own life story.
