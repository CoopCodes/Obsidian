They are to do a reflection task answering the following 2 questions:Â 

1. What do I believe and why? - personal life reflection
2. Who do I believe Jesus is? - refer to at least one gospel story of his life.

# What do I believe in and Why?
I believe in Jesus, and the triune God! He has been with me throughout my whole life, guiding me on a path towards Love, I grew up without a father, and he has been my Father throughout all things. My mum is the most faithful person I have known, she was faithful to God, and knew that he would find a way for me to grow good, and not resentful; And he came through! Looking back on my life it is so apparent that he has worked throughout it, I have a job in programming, which is my passion; and amazing friends and family, God so amazing, sovereign and all-loving. I have many hardships to come, and that I have endured, but I know that all will be well, as Jesus has assured everyone's salvation.


# Who do I believe Jesus is?
I believe he is the savior of the world! (John 3:17), he saved all of humanity 2000 years ago on the cross, most of us just haven't realized it yet. And I believe he will be the judge, but his judgments will not undo his savings:

*For neither is the Father judging anyone, but has given all judging to the Son, 23 that **all may be honoring the Son**, according as they are honoring the Father. He who is not honoring the Son is not honoring the Father Who sends Him.*
	John 5:23 (CLV)

All judgment has been given to the Son that all may be honoring the Son, and the Father. His Judgment is Love, God hates sin, so his Wrath will destroy anything in a person that is not of Love (2 Thess 1:9, https://studybible.info/Rotherham/2%20Thessalonians%201:9). I believe that if I believe in God, I will not go into a resurrection of Judging, but into a resurrection of Life (John 5:29, https://studybible.info/CLV/John%205:29). I believe Jesus will judge the wicked, and they will be thrown into the Lake of Fire, the second death, and they shall die to their old self, the false self.

*knowing this, that our old humanity was crucified together with Him, that the body of Sin may be nullified, for us by no means to be still slaving for Sin, 7 **for one who dies has been justified from Sin**. 8 Now if we died together with Christ, we believe that we shall be living together with Him also, 9 having perceived that Christ, being roused from among the dead, is no longer dying. Death is lording it over Him no longer,*

Yet the person will be saved, but as through fire:

*If anyone's work shall be burned up, he will forfeit it, yet he shall be saved, yet thus, as through fire.*
	1 Corinthians 3:15 https://studybible.info/CLV/1%20Corinthians%203:15

Thus, all sin shall be obliterated out of the person, and thus all the prohibitors stopping them from choosing God. And therefore, the prophecy can be fulfilled:

*By Myself I swear. From My mouth fares forth righteousness, and My word shall not be recalled. For to Me **shall bow every knee**, and **every tongue shall acclaim to Elohim.**"*
	Isaiah 45:23

And so that God may be All in All, with all things being reconciled back to him:

*and through Him to reconcile all to Him* (Christ) *(making peace through the blood of His cross), through Him, whether those on the earth or those in the heavens.*
	 Colossians 1:20 CLV (https://studybible.info/CLV/Colossians%201:20-21) *(Annotations mine)*

*Now, whenever all may be subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also shall be subjected to Him Who subjects all to Him, that God may be **All in all**.*
	1 Corinthians 15:28


So therefor, Jesus is the Savior of the World, and the Judge of the world. He will make all things new (Rev. 21:5); And I can put my total faith and trust in the all-loving, all-powerful, all-knowing, unchanging God, praise be to him! I can say with confidence to a homeless person on the street, that *"Fear not, all will be well one day."*, to the hundreds of people dyeing per hour, starving, that *all will be well*, because the 1 true God has commanded so.
