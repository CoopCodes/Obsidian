The statement that "Phone usage increases productivity" is absolutely absurd and in fact, using the words "phone" and "productivity" together sounds like a contradiction. Whilst I agree that at the technological improvements that mobile phones have brought is beneficial to companies, and to their efficiency, I argue that the diminishing attention span that phones are bringing, outweighs their increase in efficiency.
In order for me to explain, we must understand what *attention span* is, one of the main causes of low productivity. 
cambridge.org defines attention span as: "the length of time that someone can keep their thoughts and interest fixed on something:" *(1)*
In other words, attention span is the amount of time that a person can focus on something. For example, a person with a high attention span are able to read plain books for hours on end, without break. A person with a low attention span would have to play music when working, or movies while playing video games.
According to healthline.com *(2)* a low attention span causes "poor performance at work or school", and an "inability to complete daily tasks". This is for several reasons:
- Focusing on just your work for several moments, can cause dopamine withdrawals, and desire another hit of dopamine, like picking up your phone.
- Adding stimuli whilst working, such as music, can decrease your capacity to critically think.
- Listening in class for long times is hard, and you phase in-and-out of listening.
What causes a low attention span? Throughout the past 5–10 years the rise of short form content such as TikTok and YouTube Shorts have grown to immense popularity. vidico.com *(4)* states that 90% of internet traffic is short-form content, and yaguara.co *(5)* states that the average user spends an estimated 58.4 hours per week on TikTok. This, combine with the growing ownership of phones, enables short form content to be more accessible than ever. 
Short form content has a direct correlation to attention span, thecampanile.org summarizes this statement well:
*“After watching a ton of these Instagram Reels, I tend to get more impatient when I’m trying to do longer tasks like homework because I’ve been trained to digest really fast content,” Wang said.*
Short form content enables users to immediately get entertainment whenever they are bored, if they're watching a clip and get bored, just swipe up, and there's another completely new piece of content for them to consume. Generally, the content in short-form is less than 60 seconds, and the average user watch time is 40 seconds *(8)*. As people continue to get more and more desensitized to this type of content, their attention span will lessen, and lessen. This has been scientifically proven:
- The average attention span has dropped **from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds in 2013.** *(9)*
And this diminishing attention span directly influences a persons' productivity:
"*In today's fast-paced world, having a shorter attention span can significantly reduce productivity and lead to increased errors and mistakes. With the constant barrage of information and stimuli, it can be challenging to stay focused for extended periods of time. Unfortunately, this can have negative consequences on one's work and personal life.*" (9)
I personally agree with the above, throughout the day, if I have at all watched any short form content, my attention span is much lower, and I can barely do any schoolwork, have to at least listen to some music. I am jumpier, and prone to distractions, especially when working on my computer.
It has been concluded that low attention span is diminishing towards ones' productivity, and that lowering attention span is directly linked to the rise in short-from content apps, and the rise in short-form content apps is because of the rise in smart-phones; Therefore, the rise in mobile phones has a direct correlation in the decreased productivity of persons.

# Questions:
1. How much do these added "efficiencies" actually help the industry.
2. Do you think this outweighs the immense effect that short-form content is having on productivity?
3. Have you seen the effect of short-form content in your own life, and productivity at school or work?
4. Name a Short-form content creator (**not a YouTuber**)?: The longer you take to answer, the more you're proving that short-form content is affecting your mind, and memory retention.
5. If you were a teacher, would you let your kids have phones in the classroom?


**Question 1**: For the topic of “excessive use of digital devices” you have decided to focus on a very specific concept: social media and the use of phones. I personally don’t believe it’s fair to say that social media and phones are what should be focused on even though it is a widely discussed issue. There are many forms of the use of digital devices such as playing video games, reading a book online, watching educational content (such as Khan Academy) or even online shopping. Is it fair to say that these also contribute towards the lack in attention span when instead, they contribute towards bringing people together and having access to resources that might otherwise be hard to obtain?

*I agree that there are resources accessible on phones that can contribute to bring people together, and gaining knowledge. However, these resources are more likely to be obtained on computers, not on phones*

**Question 2**: Are there any types of phone activities or applications which are more likely to decrease attention span and productivity?

**Question 3**: How do you think the benefits of mobile phones (such as efficiency and accessibility) compare with the negative consequence of a reduced attention span? Do you believe there is a balanced perspective on this particular topic?

**Question 4**: Do you think there is any way one could potentially avoid the negative consequences of the excessive use of social media?

**Question 5**: Would you make the same argument of reduced attention span and decreased productivity if the focus shifts to other digital devices such as computers or even smart watches?


## Prahb Questions

**Question 1**:

I do believe that there is benefit to some programs that are accessible on phones; However, video games is not one of them. And whilst they can provide a benefit, all these things can be also used on a computer. I believe though, that the negative effects of social media vastly outweigh these small benefits. Even if there is a small increase in productivity with phones, the fact that social media is being used by a person means their attention span is decreasing NO MATTER if they also use it productively. The average attention span has dropped **from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds in 2013.** 
https://www.alisbh.com/blog/average-human-attention-span-statistics-and-facts
**And the amount of phone owners in 2016 was 3.67 billion, but in 2023, it was 6.92 Billion.**

These statistics show that even if there is a small benefit, the effect of a low attention span vastly outweighs it, and can affect day to day life dramatically; Making it harder to concentrate, thus work, spending less time connecting with people, and even developing ADHD symptoms.

These statistics show that there is a strong correlation between amount of phones owned, and average attention span, AND EVEN ADHD diagnosis's. Whilst I agree that there are some benefits, the very ownership of a phone can increase your attention span, especially with social media involved.


**Question 2**:

Certainly TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, video games, basically anything that incentivizes a person to go on their phone has the ability to decrease attention span.


**Question 3**: 

See my answer to **Question 1**.


**Question 4**:

Yes, break your phone, or get an app such as 'minimalistic phone', which can block your usage of those social media apps. But even then it is still very tempting to keep on using them, as social media is also often the way you message friends; Companies have done this purposely in order to get people to stay on their platform, and leaving social media can make you feel left out.

**Question 5**:

No. As shown before there is a strong correlation between smartphone usage, and attention span, this is due to the ease of looking at your phone, and the amount of things you can do on that phone. Smartwatches are easier to look at, but harder to really do anything on like watching social media. And computers are too hard to open, and to use on the go.
