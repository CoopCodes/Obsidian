# 3.1 The Nucleus
___
## Nuclear notation 
- **Atomic number, $Z$** - The number of protons in a nucleus.
- **Neutron number, $N$** - The number of neutrons in a nucleus.
- **Mass number, $A$** - The sum of the **Atomic Number** and **Neutron Number**, $A =Z+N$
	
The **nuclide** is notated by the following:$$_{mass\space number}^{atomic\space number}nuclide\space symbol$$
Or in math notation:$$_A^ZX$$
The top number is always bigger than or the same as the bottom, or $Z\geq A$.


# History
The atom is the basic building block of all matter. The first model of the atom was called the 'plum pudding model'. This model described the neutral atom as negatively charged 'plums' of electrons embedded in a loosely packed 'pudding' of positive charge.

# Nuclear structure
## The Proton
The nucleus of an atom is made up of positive charges called protons. A **proton** has a mass of almost 2000 times of the electron. The number of protons determines the species, or element, of the atom. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton; helium has two. 

## The Neutron
Since the protons in certain atoms did not add up to the mass of the nucleus. It was suggested that there must be another sub-atomic  that would have no charge. The mass of a particle is given in **unified atomic mass unit $u$**; Charge is given in **coulombs** ($C$).

## Sub-atomic Particle properties
| Particle  | Location | Charge ($C$) | Mass ($kg$) | Relative Mass |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Electron  | Surrounding nucleus | $-1.602*10^{-19}$ | $9.109384*10^{-31}$ | $\frac{1}{1836}$ |
| Proton    | Nucleus  | $+1.602*10^{-19}$ | $1.6726219*10^{-27}$ | 1 |
| Neutron   | Nucleus  | 0 | $1.674927*10^{-27}$ | 1.0014 |
# Isotopes and notation
## Isotopes and nuclides
Protons and neutrons comprise the nucleus, so these particles collectively are called *nucleons* and the nucleus they make up is called a *nuclide*. And **isotope** is an atom that contains the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons than another atom with the same number of protons. Chemically, it behaves the same. But has different nuclear properties

- protium
	- Number of protons in the nucleus: 1
	- Number of neutrons in the nucleus: 0
	- Number of nucleons in the nucleus: 1
	- Symbol:  $_1^1$$H$ or  $_1^1$$p$
- deuterium
	- Number of protons in the nucleus: 1
	- Number of neutrons in the nucleus: 1
	- Number of nucleons in the nucleus: 2
	- Symbol:  $_1^2$$H$ or  $_1^2$$D$
## Nuclear notation 
- **Atomic number, $Z$** - The number of protons in a nucleus.
- **Neutron number, $N$** - The number of neutrons in a nucleus.
- **Mass number, $A$** - The sum of the **Atomic Number** and **Neutron Number**, $A =Z+N$

The **nuclide** is notated by the following:$$_{mass\space number}^{atomic\space number}nuclide\space symbol$$
Or in math notation:$$_A^ZX$$
The top number is always bigger than or the same as the bottom, or $Z\geq A$.
