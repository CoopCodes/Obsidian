In 1896, Henri Becquerel wrapped a metal Maltese cross in a piece of unexposed film, and a chunk of uranium ore, and left them in a desk drawer. On the following morning, he found that the film had become exposed. The only object that could have done that was some kind of **radiation** originating from the uranium.

**Radioactivity is the natural spontaneous decay of a nucleus into smaller pieces with the emission of other particles and/or energy in the form of electro magnetic waves.** 

# Stable and unstable isotopes
A **nuclide** is said to be stable if it does not lose or gain any protons, neutrons, or energy over time.
- There are 250 stable nuclides that exist naturally.

## Nuclear Forces
### Electrostatic Force
For sub-atomic particles to stay together, and form an atom, there has to be a force keeping it together. this is called the **coulomb forge** or **electrostatic**. 
- The force is repuilsive for two particles aof the same charge, and attractive for two particles of opposite charge. There is no force between
