- Thankyou for guiding this new family, and being such an extraordinary head of the house, you have so much stress on you. Yet you do not crumble, your Godly compassion overcomes.
- The past couple weeks have taught me a lot about myself, but also so much about you. You are a role model to me, you have shown me your relentless, reckless, love. I am amazed that you keep everyone's opinion and thoughts in mind when dealing with conflict.


I love you so much Mum. Thankyou for guiding this new family, you are the only one who could. Thankyou for being my Mum, you're the only one I could ever have for all eternity. Despite everything, you are still everything everyone needs. Despite the hatred, conflict, and bitterness of the last couple weeks, your Godly compassion for everyone overcomes. 
You are the biggest role model in my life (other than Jesus), I am in awe of your relentless and reckless love for everyone, it sets a standard in which I hope one day i can meet. It is a fact, that you have the strength to endure anything life gives you. Words cannot describe how much I admire this, your strength and persistence through anything, James 5:11. When you smile I can see God in your eyes, God's love. 

Thankyou so much mum.
