# Climate Change, and the Sinking Nation of Tuvalu
# Thesis
Dear people of the United Nations, thankyou for coming today to the 2024 United Nations Climate Summit, to begin, here is a quote from Setani, a citizen from the sinking nation of Tuvalu: “Before, the sand used to stretch out far, and when we swam we could see the sea floor, and the coral. Now, it is cloudy all the time, and the coral is dead. Tuvalu is sinking.” - Setani, citizen of Tuvalu *(Eleanor de Jong & Gallagher, 2019)*
And a quote from Tuvalu's foreign minister: "We are sinking, but so is everyone else, and no matter if we feel the impacts today like in Tuvalu, or in 100 years, we will all still feel the dire effects of this global crisis one day." - Tuvalu's foreign minister at the Cop26 Conference *(News, 2021)*
Everyday there is another person or news outlet telling you about the rising sea levels, climate change, but in Australia, we rarely see this in our day-to-day lives. For the people of Tuvalu however, this is a reality. It is predicted that in as little as 50 years, Tuvalu could be partially or completely submerged. And if this isn't a wake-up call for immediate and drastic action to combat climate change and protect vulnerable nations like Tuvalu, then what is? Tuvalu is a reminder for the urgent need for us humans to ignore our differences, and work together to fight this ever-growing issue.

# Issue #1 - The sinking nation of Tuvalu
Over the past 30 years, Tuvalu has measured an increase of almost 6 inches in sea level, which is 0.2 inches per year! This average is somehow 1.5 times faster than the global average, this is due to the porous base of the island, also causing the island to sink. Nasa has predicted that by 2050 the sea level will have risen by 8 inches *(https://www.jpl.nasa.gov, 2023)*. All this means that 50% of all the land mass will be under water. The problem of sea level increase also brings increased flood risk, and coastal erosion. On king tides the water becomes knee-deep in most areas on the island.
With the closest major country being Hawaii or Australia, getting help is hard. Tropical storms are becoming more and more common, and if the wrong combination of storms, and high tide, occurs, there isn't much stopping nature from taking Tuvalu back. 
Australia has taken the opportunity to help the sinking island, the Australian Government has tasked James Lewis, an engineer, with devising plans to mitigate the damage to the island due to the rising sea levels. Lewis with the help of Australian sand movers, not only planned, but started construction on an extension to the island, "Basically raising the shoreline of 800m of vulnerable coast, raising it 2 meters above the current highest tides." Lewis calls it. He says this will keep them flood free until 2100. This is only the 1st part of a grand plan, to create new land for the island nation, so that the population can move onto it. Lewis is an example of what everyone should be doing, he is a representation of nations helping other nations, becoming united. And if we are to overcome climate change, everyone needs to follow in his footsteps.

# Issue #2 - Potential Loss of Culture
"In Tuvalu, our islands are sacred to us. They contain the mana of our people. They were the home of our ancestors, they are the home of our people today, and we want them to remain the home of our people into the future" - Says the Former Tuvalu Minister *(60 Minutes Australia, 2024)*
Not only is the loss of a nation tragic, and a stark reminder of the impending doom. But it is a loss of a whole culture, hundreds, thousands of years for it to develop, generations lived and died on that land. All of it devoured by the sea, whilst the small population of 12,000 will be able to flee, the culture of Tuvalu will be no longer. 
"'It's the first agreement to specifically deal with climate-related mobility,' ... 'Most people don't want to leave their homes, they have very deep ancestral ties to their land and sea – but this offers a lifeline.'" – The University of New Souths Wales professor said. *(Eleanor de Jong & Gallagher, 2019)*
If the worst case scenario occurs, Australia is providing a way out to the Tuvalu people, giving the people the opportunity to "Live, study and work in Australia" *(Eleanor de Jong & Gallagher, 2019)*. They are allowing 280 people per year to leave to Australia. But this is the last thing the Tuvalu people want, with their population being spread geographically, it would dissolve their tight-nit and people-orientated culture, eroding their language, arts, rituals, social structures, and their connection to the land. The Tuvalu people are resilient and determined people, they will not leave their home, until their land is above water once again. There are big plans to help Tuvalu, some have already started, and with the combined help of all the whole world, the Tuvalu people can have the hope that their next generation will be able to grow up and thrive on the beautiful land of Tuvalu.
# Issue #3 - The Required Global Unity
Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner is a poet, and climate change activist from the Marshall Islands, an island predicted to have the same doom as Tuvalu. She read this poem at the United Nations Climate Summit Opening Ceremony in 2014. Through this poem, she beautifully illustrated to hundreds of powerful individuals about the tragic effect climate change has on her country, it's culture, and the next generation to come. The poem is addressed to her daughter, who may not be able to have a home country to raise her kids. Kathy uses line breaks to highlight each new line as a new statement, and a powerful one. The list she makes of all the other islands like the Marshalls gives the reader a jolt of reality, and that these are just the first victims of an exponentially growing problem. On top of this, she uses personification to target her daughter, and the wider next-generation, using the line "because baby we are going to fight". You can practically feel the burning fire in mothers heart, just by merely reading that line in your head. Imagine the feelings going through the Summit when she read this aloud, with her daughter in her hand, feelings of sadness, anger, hope, and determination. Her poem has hopefully touched the powerful people at the Summit that day, but more people need to know, you need to know; That Climate Change is here, not some distant future, it is here, and the people of Tuvalu and The Marshall islands are suffering right now, because of it. Action needs to be made now, not tomorrow, if we do not stop now, then it is too late. But do not lose hope, and think that nothing we are doing is working, the International Energy Agency predicted that by 2030 we would have increased our renewable capacity by 300%. It is also proven that the Carbon Emissions per person has drastically decreased over the past 50 years for a large majority of countries.

# Conclusion:
The terrible situation that the island nation of Tuvalu finds itself in due to rising sea levels caused by climate change should be a wake-up call to the entire world about how bad climate change is, it is a global crisis that we cannot ignore. The people of Tuvalu are already experiencing the horrible effects of their land being swallowed up by the ocean. And Tuvalu is just the beginning, as many other low-lying islands like the Marshall Islands have a similar destiny if nothing is completed on a global scale. We cannot let years of culture be destroyed, mass relocations of people. Powerful leaders have to hear the words people like Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner. Because if we don't all come together as 1 species to fight climate change, then it will be too late for not just Tuvalu, but all humanity.
