# Introduction

Child slavery has unfortunately existed for thousands of years with the first documented child slaves being in ancient Egypt as well as Greece and Rome. Working as labourers, these children where as young as just 6 years old being forced to endure intense labour with no pay. In modern day society, first world countries have the fortunate laws that prevent child slavery and every workplace In Australia, has a minimum age requirement. These laws are called “human rights”, and unpaid labour is illegal in Australia. Child slavery is also incredibly unethical and morally wrong. Children should not have to endure intense forced labour as well as no child should have to suffer sex-slavery. But this is an unfortunate reality for 152 million children alive today.

Children are the lifeblood and legacy of humanity and will be the future of human civilization and the continuation of the human race. However, greedy profit driven organisations are denying children their freedom and giving children lifelong scars and trauma as well as many children never having the opportunity to free themselves from the slave trade. Human trafficking and slavery are considered the second largest illegal source of income with the slave industry generate of $150,000,000 dollars with an estimated third of money generated in first world countries like Australia. It is our responsibility to stand up against the vile acts of the child slavery industry which is prevalent in our society especially when we as a nation is hand in the continuation of slavery.

Child Trafficking: A Devastating Form of Child Slavery

Child trafficking, a subset of child slavery, involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of children for exploitation. This exploitative practice deprives children of their basic rights, exposes them to various forms of abuse, and perpetuates a cycle of vulnerability. Here are key points to consider when exploring child trafficking:

1. Recruitment and Transportation

Children are often deceived, coerced, or abducted into trafficking situations, with promises of better opportunities or false pretenses.

Traffickers exploit children's vulnerabilities, such as poverty, lack of education, or social marginalization, to lure them into trafficking schemes.

2. Exploitation and Abuses

Trafficked children are subjected to various forms of exploitation, including forced labor, commercial sexual exploitation, organ trafficking, and forced begging.

They endure physical, emotional, and psychological abuse at the hands of traffickers, often in harsh and degrading conditions.

3. Impact on Children

Child trafficking inflicts profound and long-lasting harm on children, affecting their physical health, mental well-being, and overall development.

Victims of trafficking face a loss of agency, identity, and autonomy, leading to severe trauma and psychological distress.

4. Global Challenges and Responses

Child trafficking is a transnational crime that requires coordinated efforts at local, national, and international levels to combat effectively.

Governments, law enforcement agencies, civil society organizations, and international bodies are working together to prevent trafficking, protect victims, and prosecute perpetrators.

5. Prevention and Intervention

Prevention strategies include raising awareness, improving access to education, addressing root causes of vulnerability, and strengthening child protection systems.

Intervention efforts focus on identifying and rescuing trafficked children, providing them with support services, such as counseling, rehabilitation, and reintegration into society.

Child trafficking represents a grave violation of human rights and demands urgent attention and concerted action to ensure the safety and well-being of all children. By understanding the complexities of this issue and implementing targeted interventions, we can work towards eradicating child slavery in all its forms.

**ai**: Based on the content provided, the three main points Rocco seems to be trying to portray in his persuasive essay are:

1. Child slavery is a prevalent and serious global issue that violates human rights and affects millions of children worldwide. He provides statistics from the International Labour Organization (ILO) to highlight the scale of the problem.

2. Child slavery has severe psychological impacts on its victims, causing lifelong trauma and scars. He mentions that children are denied their freedom and subjected to intense forced labor and exploitation, which can have profound effects on their mental well-being and overall development.

3. There is a need for collective responsibility and action to combat child slavery, especially in first-world countries like Australia, which may be indirectly contributing to the continuation of this practice through the demand for goods and services produced by child labor.

Rocco appears to be building a persuasive argument by establishing the prevalence and severity of child slavery, highlighting its detrimental impacts, and emphasizing the moral and ethical imperative to address this issue, particularly in developed nations that may be inadvertently perpetuating the problem.

# Thesis
“Before, the sand used to stretch out far, and when we swam we 
could see the sea floor, and the coral. Now, it is cloudy all the time, 
and the coral is dead. Tuvalu is sinking.” 
- Setani, citizen of Tuvalu
"We are sinking, but so is everyone else, and no matter if we feel
the impacts today like in Tuvalu, or in 100 years, we will all
still feel the dire effects of this global crisis one day." 
- Tuvalu's foreign minister at the Cop26 Conference

Everyday there is another person or news outlet telling you about
the rising sea levels, climate change, but in Australia, we rarely
see this in our day-to-day lives. For the people of Tuvalu however, 
this is a reality. It is predicted that in as little as 50 years, 
Tuvalu could be submerged. And if this isn't a wake-up call for 
immediate and drastic action to combat climate change and protect 
vulnerable nations like Tuvalu, then what is? Tuvalu is a reminder 
for the urgent need for us humans to ignore our differences,
and work together to fight this ever-growing issue.

My fellow citizens of the world, we stand today at a critical juncture in the fight against climate change. The haunting words of Setani, a resident of Tuvalu, echo in our minds: "Before, the sand used to stretch out far, and when we swam we could see the sea floor, and the coral. Now, it is cloudy all the time, and the coral is dead. Tuvalu is sinking."

These are not mere words; they are a stark reality for the people of Tuvalu and countless other low-lying island nations. As the sea levels continue to rise, their very existence is threatened. Homes, livelihoods, and entire cultures are at risk of being swallowed by the relentless tide of climate change.

We cannot turn a blind eye to this crisis. Tuvalu's plight serves as a sobering reminder that we are all interconnected in this global challenge. No nation, no matter how powerful or wealthy, is immune to the devastating consequences of a warming planet. As Tuvalu's foreign minister poignantly stated at the COP26 Conference, "We are sinking, but so is everyone else, and no matter if we feel the impacts today like in Tuvalu, or in 100 years, we will all still feel the dire effects of this global crisis one day."

The time for complacency has passed. We must heed the urgent calls for action from the people of Tuvalu and other vulnerable nations. Their voices, echoing across the vast oceans, demand that we rise to the occasion and take decisive steps to combat climate change.

It is our collective responsibility to ignore our differences and work together towards a sustainable future. Developed nations like Australia must take a leadership role in mitigation efforts, investing in renewable energy, and providing support to affected countries. We must embrace innovative solutions, implement adaptation measures, and forge a path towards a greener, more resilient world.

Let us not be remembered as the generation that turned a deaf ear to the cries of those whose homelands are disappearing beneath the waves. Let us be the generation that stood up, united, and took bold action to protect our planet and safeguard the future of all humanity.

The time to act is now. For the sake of Tuvalu, for the sake of our children, and for the sake of our shared home, let us rise to the challenge and forge a legacy of hope, resilience, and environmental stewardship.
