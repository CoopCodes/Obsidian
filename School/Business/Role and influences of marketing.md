# Types of market
- Marketing exists in almost all organisations. It isn't always directed at consumers, there are business-to-business marketing.
- Marketing strategies for consumer markets will differ from those of industrial and resource markets which typically sell in bulk and require different distribution strategies. Marketing  plans and strategies must be adapted to the different types of markets and their expectations.
## Resource markets
This includes businesses that gather natural resources and the production and sale of raw materials. Products from this market are often used as inputs in the manufacturing process or sold to intermediaries. Some primary producers can retail their products directly to the public.

## Industrial Markets
An industrial product is a good, service, or idea purchased for use in producing other products. This is classified as secondary or tertiary. Such products are partly processed goods, services, supplies, or equipment used in the production process. For example, Gippsland Diary buys its milk products from dairies across Victoria, and clothing designer Cue has collaborated with textile printing company KBC in Europe for over 40 years.

## Intermediate Markets
These markets are typically referred to as wholesalers, which break down the large quantities supplied by manufacturers into smaller, more saleable units. Wholesalers generally do not sell directly to consumers; however, the rise of merchant wholesalers, such as Bunnings and Costco, has altered this. They skip the next market, retail, and sell it at a low price, whereas if it were sold at a retail store, it would be upsold to give profits to both markets.

## Consumer markets
- Most easy to recognize, are referred to as retailers. 
- They sell directly to the end user of the product or service. Whenever you go to a shopping center, you are a part of the consumer market.
### Mass markets

### Market Segment

### Niche Markets 
This market further segments the segment into micro-segments. Due to its specialized nature, the goods are highly customized to meet the needs of the market, and the business is scaled accordingly.
