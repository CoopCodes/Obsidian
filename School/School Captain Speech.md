- School is great, but a lot of the information learned, is useless. I want to help that, a lot of the content learned is controlled by the government, but i want to change the things the school has control over, for example bring back Life skills.
- There are 3 ways to connect with God **worship**, **scripture** and **service**. The school does 2 of these, worship through chapel, and scripture through connect and encounter. But i also want to bring back the chapels that used to happen where we give back to the community.
- As a male without a father, i want let everyone know that i am there to help, i have been in your situation before, and im always here if you need help.

Ladies and gentlemen, teachers, and fellow students,

Today, I stand before you as a candidate for the position of school captain. I am here to share with you my vision for our school, and how I plan to make a positive impact on our education and community.

Firstly, let's address the elephant in the room. School is undeniably a great place for learning, but let's be honest, some of the information we are taught feels useless. I believe it's time for a change. As your school captain, I want to challenge the status quo and bring back life skills to our curriculum. We need to equip ourselves with practical knowledge that will truly benefit us in the real world. By expanding our education beyond textbooks and exams, we can prepare ourselves for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Furthermore, I believe that connecting with our spirituality is essential for personal growth. There are three fundamental ways to connect with God: worship, scripture, and service. Our school currently provides opportunities for worship through chapel and scripture through connect and encounter. However, I want to take it a step further. I want to reintroduce the chapels where we give back to our community. By engaging in acts of service, we not only deepen our connection with God but also develop empathy, compassion, and a sense of responsibility towards others. Together, let's make a difference in the lives of those around us.

Lastly, I want to address a personal aspect of my journey. As a male without a father, I understand the challenges that many of you may face. I want you all to know that I am here to help. I have walked in your shoes, and I am committed to being a support system for each and every one of you. Whether it's academic struggles, personal issues, or simply needing someone to talk to, I am here for you. Together, we can create a nurturing environment where everyone feels valued, supported, and empowered to reach their full potential.

In conclusion, my fellow students, I stand before you today with a vision for our school that encompasses practical education, spiritual growth, and a strong support system. If elected as your school captain, I promise to work tirelessly to bring about these changes. Together, let's shape our school into a place where we not only gain knowledge but also develop essential life skills, connect with our spirituality, and support one another on our individual journeys. Thank you for your consideration, and I humbly ask for your vote.
