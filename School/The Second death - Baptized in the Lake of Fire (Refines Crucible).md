## 1 Corinthians 15 (the imperishable of the universal resurrected dead)
*22 For even as, in Adam, all are dying, thus also, in Christ, shall all be vivified.* 
	All will be resurrected.

*42 Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is roused in incorruption.*
*52 in an instant, in the twinkle of an eye, at the last trump. For He will be trumpeting, and the dead will be roused incorruptible, and we shall be changed.*
	All the dead (all people) will be roused in incorruption (immortal)

This proves that all will be resurrected, and ALL will be changes, and become incorruptible (immortal), and unable to be destroyed.


## Romans 6:6-10 (Dyeing to be free from sin)
6 For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— 7 because ***anyone* who has died has been set free from sin.**

8 **Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him**. 9 For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. 10 **The death he died, he died to sin once for all;** but the life he lives, he lives to God.

## Colossians 3:1-11 (The false self)
Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 2 Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 3 **For you died**, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 4 When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.

5 Put to death, therefore, *whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry*. 6 Because of these, **the wrath of God is coming for the sons of disobedience** <span style="color:#424958">(The wrath of God came for these THINGS, not people, his wrath shall burn away these things, just as Paul is no longer a murderer)</span>. 7 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 8 But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 9 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your **old self with its practices** 10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 11 Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, **but Christ is all, and is in all.**

1 If, then, you were roused together with Christ, be seeking that which is above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.  
2 Be disposed to that which is above, not to that on the earth,  
3 **for you died**, and your life is hid together with Christ in God.  
4 Whenever Christ, our Life, should be manifested, then you also shall be manifested together with Him in glory.  
5 **Deaden** *(put to death)*, then, your members *(body parts, aspects of your life)* that are on the earth: prostitution, uncleanness, passion, evil desire and greed, which is idolatry,  
6 because of which the indignation *(wrath, or passion)* of God is coming on the sons of stubbornness --
7 among whom you also once walked, when you lived in these things.  
8 Yet now you also be putting away all these: anger, fury, malice, calumny, obscenity out of your mouth.   
9 Do not lie to one another, **stripping off the old humanity together with its practices,**  
10 and putting on the young, which is being renewed into recognition, to accord with the Image of the One Who creates it,  
11 wherein there is no Greek and Jew, Circumcision and Uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, **but all and in all is Christ.**

## John 12:24
24 Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and **dies**, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.

## Romans 6:3-9
7 for one who dies has been justified from Sin.


*And He Who is sitting on the throne said, "Lo! New am I making all!And He is saying, "Write, for these sayings are faithful and true."*
	Revelations 21:5

*So that, if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: the primitive passed by. Lo! there has come new!"*
	2 Corinthians 5:17
Hebrews 9:27

and in the coming age, life of the world to come
