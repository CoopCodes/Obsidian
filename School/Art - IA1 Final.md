# Artist Statement
## Thoughts & Beliefs
A persons thoughts & Beliefs are core to what determines attitude, motivation, and wellbeing. During the teenage years, a persons brain is still developing and our thoughts and beliefs are often wrong, and we are afraid to reach out and get help. This disorientation is represented in my information poster, it is an embodiment of a teenagers thoughts and beliefs. The horrible advice is what teenagers internally tell themselves, it gives the reader a glimpse into what we teenagers think and believe. Throughout high school, teenagers receive countless scores on tests, exams, and their final ATAR. Whether it is from they're own influence on themselves, or teachers influence, teenagers are lead to believe these scores define us as a person. The *self worth quiz* in the artwork is a representation of these scores, and the quiz applicant is told that the result is a definition of they're lives, and they should be ashamed if they don't get the average.
## Context behind the art
The fake scenario of this poster is that it was created by a school, and handed out to students to take home, and keep for a night, they were to read through it, reflect on the advice, and complete the quiz. They return the poster and rub out their quiz answers, and the next student takes it home. All this movement to homes and schools ages the poster, thus the old look of it, the creases and burns, stains and rips. Additionally, this represents teenagers as careless, and self-destructive.
## The Form
The form in the poster is a way to rank the students on how average they are, and the poster encourages them to take the result to heart and tells them that it is a representation of them as a person. It tells them that it cannot be changed, and they should feel ashamed, guilty, and hopeless if it is not close to the average. All of school we are given scores, on tests, assessments, and our ATAR. And society tells us that we should feel these things if we don't achieve what we want, especially with our ATAR, we are told it defines our whole lives.
