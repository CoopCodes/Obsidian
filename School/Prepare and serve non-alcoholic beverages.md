- The ingredients required and the measurements **(serving size: 2 cups)**
	- **1.13kg pounds of oranges.** (typically 8 medium size oranges)
	- Plus 1 orange for garnish.

	- **Blender**
	- **Glass Cups**
	- **Nut milk bag or sieve (if preferred without pulp)**
	- **Strainer (for seeds)**
	- **Knife**

- The method you will use to prepare the beverage
	1. Peel the oranges and , optionally, remove and discard the seeds (if you're going to strain the juice then this isn't necessary).
	2. Add the orange segments to a blender. You can add a little water to help them blend if needed (1/4 cup should be more than enough not to water it down too much).
	3. Blend into a juicy, pulp consistency. Then sieve the resulting pulpy juice through a sieve or nut milk bag or alternatively if you like orange juice with pulp (for more nutrients too) then leave it as is.

- How you will present each drink, including the garnish and type of glass
