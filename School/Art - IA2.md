# Art forms:
1. Graphic design / Web design / Product design
	- Logo design, and a design system for the client.
	- Using the design system, a design for a simple website will be created, creating a good UI/UX experience. The created website design will be build out with a chosen tool (Webflow or HTML/CSS).
	- Product design - Using the design system, several products (merchandise) will be created using this.
2. 3D printing

# Artist Statement (Case Study):
The goal of making visual products, and graphics for a business is to solve a problem they have, and they need a solution to the problem. Businesses desired solutions could be **to increase brand awareness, and desirability**, or to **accurately represent a local business in a *specific industry* to potential customers searching in that *area*, enticing them to visit**. In this case, *Yelyon* is a worship festival for Christians, and their desired solutions are:
- **To accurately represent the culture, goal, and atmosphere of the festival to potential attendees, through visual means such as graphic design, and photographs. They wanted this representation to be given through:**
	- Design System
	- Logo (Which follows the *design system*)
	- Website (Which follows the *design system*)
	- Merchandise (Which <u>roughly</u> follows the *design system*)
- **To tell potential attendees when and what is happening at the festival, and why they are doing the festival. And making this information readily available through great User Experience on the Website.**

## Design Inspiration:
### Logo
#### Initial Goal
Coming into this project, my goal was to a vintage type logo and style for Yelyon as I had seen this style used by a lot of Christian brands, and mainstream brans like Ghanda. 
#### Gerardo Velasco - Yahweh

![[Pasted image 20240501112609.png]]
This has a kind of old-fashioned aesthetic, due to the bold and stylistic typography, and textures, making it look almost mediaeval, and it portrays God as old, and powerful, wise. This design put me on the path to make an old-fashioned vintage type design.

In these designs I was particularly inspired by the 2nd and 4th design, the display serif fonts used in them gave a 1980's aesthetic, best imaged by the stranger things style/logo, which aligned with my goal for the logo *(What goal)*. I used the [WhatTheFont](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont) website to find a similar/same font as the 4th, and used that as the font for the logo.

### Website
#### Sunbean Café

When looking for inspiration in project like Yelyon, an arts-oriented project, they want their website to stand out as stated in the client brief, *"clean, bold, and visually striking."* So I do not look for basic Hero section designs, and basic fonts. So, when looking through Framer Templates, and I found this design, it checked most of the boxes for a great hero design:
- **A unique design** - this type of design would not be found anywhere else.
	- Huge typography has been a trend in graphic design for the past year or two, the design combines this trend with a semi-playful yet semi-serious sans-serif, which portrays to the user the 'vibe' of the cafe; A charming and sophisticated cafe. 
	- Additionally, the navbar is at the bottom, which is almost never found, this approach is good for big typography at the top of a hero page, as top navbars in this case would throw off the visual hierarchy. However, it may not seem obvious to all users visiting the website that it is a navbar.
- **Visual hierarchy** - Some unique designs sacrifice User Experience for a beautiful design, this has not. The title is the first thing looked at, then the info pieces, then the image. 

#### Monte Real Estate Agency

![[Pasted image 20240426182228.png|600]]

This hero layout is based off a common hero layout, the two column layout, however it modifies it to have the image almost full-height, and where the title would usually left-aligned, the title is centered. This keeps the advantages of having the 2 column layout (good User Experience), yet keeps the design unique and stand out amongst competitors. The font used is a clean sans-serif which portrays the business as being very professional and modern.

| ![[Pasted image 20240501115000.png]] | 1. Testing the title with the font "General Sans", used it in a previous project and liked it.<br>2. When creating a logo, the organizations' values should be portrayed, thus the Cross was used to signify a Christian organization.<br>3. The Hebrew translation for "Yahweh Elyon" is "יהוה עֶלְיוֹן". And I tried to implement this into a logo with 3 crosses.<br>None of the above portrayed a sense of *unity*, as desired in the [[Art - IA2 - Client Brief#Logo\|Client Brief]], this is what iterations 4-9 try to implement.<br>4. Showing that YHWH and ELYN combined make the name YELYON, indicates that they are *together*, in unity.<br>5. Using the first logo, however using smaller circles joining to the "O" (with a cross inside), to symbolize the unity of people to Christ. <br>Additionally having an arrow on the N pointing upwards, to indicate a higher power.<br>6. Simplified version of 5, however does not symbolize any unity.<br>7. Took the O from the previous, and put circles around it, portraying a unity towards each other and Christ.<br>8. Rotating the previous, and placing the Hebrew translations in each circle, however not as intuitive, as<br>to the immediate viewer it would not make sense.<br>10. After the inspiration found in [[Art - IA2#Brenda Tapia - April Logos\|April Logos]], I found this font and began experimenting wi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![[Pasted image 20240510224826.png]] | 1 & 2. To portray a sense of unity in the logo, I added loops around each letter, joinging them all together, whilst it is visually appealing, and portray unity, <br>it also looks like chains, and it is the opposite of what is wanted.<br>To further portray that the festival is Christian, the 3 crosses on a hill are made, however the placement isn't perfect<br>3. Removing the chains, and adding a similar circle around the O, symbolizes how people should surround <br>God, and through that brings unity with each other.<br>4-6. Playing around with the placement of the crosses.<br>7. The crosses are underneath the circles, and creates symmetry amongst the design, and keeps the text readable<br>and the logo symbolic, this iteration is the final one, however I continue to experiment afterwards, to try and add<br>more symbolism.<br>8. Adding broken chains to symbolize how God breaks our chains, shackles. But makes the design look crowded,<br>and distracts from the main focal point.<br>9. Yelyon is a worship music festival, and I struggled with ways to portray this in the logo. In this iteration I tried to<br>add a circled serif at the bottom of the E, (<span style="background: white;">&#127926;</span>). However it breaks the 3D isometric style created by the O graphic.<br>10. Adding musical notes within the "Y", but again breaks the style of the logo. <br>Ultimately option 7 was chosen for its simplicity, recognizability, symbolisms, and aesthetics. It effectively portrays<br>the desired traits listed in the Client Brief, through visually pleasing means. |

#### Website - Hero Section
When beginning a website, the hero section is the most important part, it is where I come up with the main style of the design system, the colors, typography, and main images.

Attempted to get the "worship" word in the title row.
#### Positives

<span style="color:#ff4d4d">- Bad visual hierarchy, the user does not now where to look as the sentence is too long.</span>

*The hero section turned out great, however it did not incorporate the logo, as it did not have a similar style, and making a website around that style is very difficult to get right. The logo will be used in the other products however.*

##### Front

The main graphic in the is an extract from the logo, and captures everything that the logo portrays. This is visually appealing, and tells people looking at the shirt what the event is, and represents the event well, showing the festival to be a new-age, non-conservative meeting, due to the bold graphic design styles.

#### Poster
The design adds onto the shirt graphic, and gives a more 1600s old style, with the manuscripts, and hebrew, and clouded textures. The inverted gradient also highlights the fact of the the festivals new-age theme.
