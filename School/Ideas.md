	- School is great, but a lot of the information learned, is useless. I want to help that, a lot of the content learned is controlled by the government, but i want to change the things the school has control over, for example bring back Life skills.
- There are 3 ways to connect with God **worship**, **scripture** and **service**. The school does 2 of these, worship through chapel, and scripture through connect and encounter. But i also want to bring back the chapels that used to happen where we give back to the community.
- As a male without a father, i want let everyone know that i am there to help, i have been in your situation before, and im always here if you need help.
The above is some dot points of what I would like to do if i become school captain. Based on this, please write a 1-3 minute speech.

Ladies and gentlemen, teachers, and fellow students,

Today, I stand before you as a candidate for the position of school captain. I am here to share with you my vision for our school, and how I plan to make a positive impact on our education and community.

Firstly, let's address the elephant in the room. School is undeniably a great place for learning, but let's be honest, some of the information we are taught feels useless. I believe it's time for a change. As your school captain, I want to challenge the status quo and bring back life skills to our curriculum. We need to equip ourselves with practical knowledge that will truly benefit us in the real world. By expanding our education beyond textbooks and exams, we can prepare ourselves for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Furthermore, I believe that connecting with our spirituality is essential for personal growth. There are three fundamental ways to connect with God: worship, scripture, and service. Our school currently provides opportunities for worship through chapel and scripture through connect and encounter. However, I want to take it a step further. I want to reintroduce the chapels where we give back to our community. By engaging in acts of service, we not only deepen our connection with God but also develop empathy, compassion, and a sense of responsibility towards others. Together, let's make a difference in the lives of those around us.

Lastly, I want to address a personal aspect of my journey. As a male without a father, I understand the challenges that many of you may face. I want you all to know that I am here to help. I have walked in your shoes, and I am committed to being a support system for each and every one of you. Whether it's academic struggles, personal issues, or simply needing someone to talk to, I am here for you. Together, we can create a nurturing environment where everyone feels valued, supported, and empowered to reach their full potential.

In conclusion, my fellow students, I stand before you today with a vision for our school that encompasses practical education, spiritual growth, and a strong support system. If elected as your school captain, I promise to work tirelessly to bring about these changes. Together, let's shape our school into a place where we not only gain knowledge but also develop essential life skills, connect with our spirituality, and support one another on our individual journeys. Thank you for your consideration, and I humbly ask for your vote.

Dear Students, Teachers, Mr. Mattner, Mrs. Jacupec, and Mr. McClintock.
As most of you know, my name is Cooper Fieldhouse. 
I've been waiting for this day for 6 years when I lost primary school captain to Matthew Runnalls, so this is for you Matty, AND the amazing school in which I have the privilege of attending. 
What a segue, there's your word of the week sentence Ms. Turner. 





School is an amazing place for learning, socialization, and sport. But a lot of the content is not applicable in real life. Don't get me wrong it is **useful**, whilst you might not use algebra when you graduate, you will use the problem solving skills that you learn in math, same with a lot of the other subject.

But honestly, school is lacking applicable things that one day you will have to face. Taxes, Finding and getting a job, changing a tire, And so much more. 
My 1st thing as school captain would be to **bring back life skills**, we had this class last year for a small period of time.

Dear Students, Teachers, Mr. Mattner, Mrs. Jacupec, and Mr. McClintock,

As most of you know, my name is Cooper Fieldhouse. Today, I want to share with you my perspective on school and how I believe it can be improved. School, in my opinion, is a great place where kids can socialize, play sports, and build the core foundational knowledge that will shape their lives. However, I also believe that there are certain aspects of our education that could be enhanced to better prepare us for the real world.

While the content we learn in school is undeniably useful, it often lacks direct applicability to real-life situations. For example, while we may not use algebra in our everyday lives, the problem-solving skills we acquire through math are invaluable. Similarly, while we may already be proficient in speaking English, it is essential to learn how to effectively communicate with co-workers in a professional setting.

That being said, there are several practical skills that are not adequately addressed in our current curriculum. Skills such as understanding taxes, finding and securing employment, and even basic car maintenance like changing a tire are all essential for adult life. Therefore, as school captain, my first priority would be to advocate for the inclusion of these life skills in our education.

I propose that these life skills be incorporated into our school schedule, perhaps during the connect period, for a few weeks each term. While I understand that the final decision lies with the teachers, I am more than willing to take on the responsibility of organizing these sessions myself.

By introducing these practical skills, we can better equip ourselves for the challenges that lie ahead in the real world. It is my belief that by bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, we can create a more well-rounded educational experience for all students.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope you will consider my proposal for the betterment of our school.

Sincerely,
Cooper Fieldhouse

Good afternoon, students and teachers.
I'm Cooper Fieldhouse, and I want to show you why you should do the thing where you tick the box that says you vote for me.

School is a great place for learning, socialization, sport, and a whole range of other things. But something we are not taught, are basic life skills, real applicable things that a lot of students struggle with after graduating, because they haven't been taught it. Taxes, finding a job, changing a tire, and so much more. I would try my very hardest to make this school useful through bringing back *life skills* class a couple weeks a term. And when you get out of school, you will immediately have an advantage over other people from other schools. And our school could be known for producing real-life ready students, who have street smarts.

Another thing I miss that school used to have, were those practical chapels, where we would give back to the community. Last time we made shoeboxes of useful items for struggling mothers. Not only does this help other people, but it makes *you* feel good, which is not the reason we are doing this, but helps. And doing it in the name of God gives us another way to connect with God apart from worship, prayer, and scripture. It reflects the school and it's values to people in the community in a way advertisements could never.

Serving this school is something I have wanted to do and are extremely passionate about for the 12 years i have been here, and I will be personally organizing the life skills class, and practical chapel, and many other school events, like i have in the past. I want you all to know that you can approach me with any problem you have, and i can help you, get the help you need, or just listen. 

"The world is your oyster." And through the things i will implement in the school, i want to make each and all of you the world your oyster.
And i feel like i can represent our school is an

Thankyou for listening.
