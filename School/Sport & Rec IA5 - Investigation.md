# Introduction
## Identify
**Basketball** is an extremely popular sport among youth throughout the whole world, but mostly western society. In Australia it is the 7th most popular sport among children (ranked by Participation rate). One of the biggest reasons for its popularity is its flexibility to work almost all aspects of physical and mental game, hand eye coordination, speed, athleticism, game IQ, and so much more. Basketball has increased popularized over the years due the NBA growing in popularity. One of the most enjoyable parts of basketball is dunking, and jumping high, and the aggressiveness of it. This is why **SlamBall** was created, it takes the high-jumping, high-adrenaline part of basketball, and turns it up to 100.

### Timeline
```timeline
[line-3, body-2]
+ 1999
+ Idea of SlamBall
+ Mason Gordon drew out the concept for SlamBall on a napkin. The idea was inspired by basketball video games line "NBA Jam" and "NBA Street". "The TV producer imagined a full-contact basketball-football hybrid amplified by trampolines — sorry, “springbeds” or “tramps,” as Gordon will quickly correct you." (_Greenberg_, 2023)

+ 1999 - </br>2002
+ The original SlamBall
+ Originally SlamBall was pre-taped from a Los Angeles studio, and cut down to a 30 minute show to be shown on SpikeTV.

+ 2004
+ Going from pre-recorded to live.
+ Pre-recording games wasn't what the business owners wanted, they were set on doing live games. However, when they couldn't convince Spike, slamball was shut down.

+ 2008
+ A momentary revival in 2008
+ A momentary revival of slamball occured in 2008, with CBS airing a full season of the sport. 

+ 2023
+ Fifteen years later
+ When the hash tag *#BringBackSlamBall* started to trend on social media, the business partners started a funding round, where several investors raised $11 million dollars. This means they could fund another season for 2023, right after the NBA finals, to direct the most possible NBA viewers to the sport.

### Barrier
##### Basketball Barriers
- Easier for taller people, there is a huge skill gap for tall people and short people, if you are short you have to jump high to be successful.
- Boring for basketball viewers who don't understand basketball.

##### How SlamBall overcame
- The trampolines make it so people of all height can dunk, in fact it is harder for taller people to dunk, as they tend to be less athletic and slow.
- SlamBall is just constant action, dunking, and physical contact, and easy for viewers to understand and enjoy.
