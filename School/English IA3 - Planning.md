7 Stages of Grief, Scene 5 - Photography Story

# Central idea
- Show a bad day for the character, something that represents how much the Aborigines still have to go through.
	- She's working at a cash registry, with her white co-worker, Stacy. Neither of them are attending to anyone, and a person comes to pay. 
	- The main characters calls to him to go to her one, as she is closer, but he looks at her but goes to Stacy's one instead.
	- She's angry and drives home after work with loud music on, and doesn't see a semi-trailer coming beside her, and gets hit.

# Rising Action
- She's working at a cash registry, with her white co-worker, Stacy. Neither of them are attending to anyone, and a person comes to pay. 
- The main characters calls to him to go to her one, as she is closer, but he looks at her but goes to Stacy's one instead.

# Complication
- She's angry and drives home after work with loud music on, and doesn't see a semi-trailer coming beside her, and gets hit.
- She dies unknowingly dies
- But instead of everything going black, her head began to look up, towards the sky. 

# Climax
- She began to float upwards, as she got higher, the more at peace she began to feel. 
- Her vision began to change
- She saw this infinitely bright light in the distance, yet it wasn't hard to look at. It was not the sun.
- A sense of overwhelming peace, love radiated from the light, welcoming her from hundreds of miles away, yet so close.
- As she got closer, she began to see that it was actually 3 beings. 
- bla bla bla
- She sees an ocean of people, spirits, lights. And somehow she is able to recognize each of them, without a face.
